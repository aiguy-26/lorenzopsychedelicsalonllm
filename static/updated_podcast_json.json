        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More SupportLorenzo on Patreon.com PROGRAM NOTES: In this insightful talk, Terence McKenna delves into the intricacies of human cognition, emphasizing the stark difference between smart and less intelligent individuals as a matter of pattern recognition from the same data. He challenges the conventional notion of language being an innate, genetically driven trait by highlighting its unique emergence compared to other natural processes. McKenna further explores the transformative power of consciousness, likening the hunt for arrowheads to an intentional act distinct from natural occurrences like lightning. This discussion underscores the profound impact of human intent and the shaping of our world through conscious action. Books by Nick Herbert Herbert’s books, such as “Quantum Reality” and “Faster Than Light,” brought quantum mechanics to a broader audience and inspired discussions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the EPR paradox, and Bell’s inequality. These discussions, in turn, contributed to the ongoing development of quantum computing by fostering a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles and paradoxes underlying quantum theory."

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More SupportLorenzo on Patreon.com PROGRAM NOTES: In this engaging and entertaining talk, Terence McKenna shares a mind-bending theory about the universe, combining astronomy, ancient civilizations, and quantum physics. He suggests that a catastrophic event 32,000 years ago at the galactic core could have triggered the development of human language. His discussion covers quasars, gamma rays, and the concept of non-locality in quantum physics, suggesting that the universe communicates important messages across vast distances instantly. The talk also explores the potential for time travel, the significance of the Mayan calendar, and the role of humans in preserving novelty and life in the universe. As is often the case, Terence emphasizes the importance of skepticism, urging listeners to critically evaluate information and seek the truth, while weaving in personal anecdotes and humor to keep the audience engaged. As he says, “I’m not interested in selling a line here. I’m interested in triggering self-reflective and analytical thought.” Harvard Scientists Say There May Be an Unknown, Technologically Advanced Civilization Hiding on Earth"

If you don’t want to hear Terence talking about his Timewave idea yet again, then you should skip this podcast. In this recording, Terence McKenna introduces a concept he humorously names the “Habit Reflex Increment” (HRI). He discusses the need for a unit to measure habit, reflecting on the significance of such a concept in understanding human behavior. McKenna jokes about not naming the unit after himself, contrasting his name with those of renowned scientists like Ohm or Ampere, which he finds more fitting for scientific terms. He then shifts his focus to a broader philosophical reflection, asserting that the struggle humanity faces is not eternal. He conveys an optimistic message, declaring that “novelty is winning.” According to McKenna, the emergence of new ideas and innovations will ultimately prevail, bringing positive transformation and progress. Of course, you will have to listen to many more little details about the Timewave than a lot of people can put up with."

It is from June of 1984. I think this is Terence’s best and most clearly detailed description of the psychedelic experience. And that is why I’m repodcasting it now, rather than refer you to a podcast that I first published in April of 2014.Among other little gem in this talk where Terence said that of all the people he’d given DMT to over many years, only FOUR of them reported an experience like the ones he described. And then, he admitted that, and I quote: “every single one of them had been primed by me.” Podcast 396 – “A Freely Evolving Topology of Light & Sound” (This is the first podcast of this talk.(The title on the cassette is Mind, Molecules and Magic)"

In every environment, in every ecosystem there are plants that either singly, or in combination with nearby plants, will deliver powerful mind-altering experiences.” “For the person who does their homework, there is no conflict between the wish to experience these things and their legal status.” (This was in response to a question about legal highs.) “Drugs often have more effect on the people who don’t take them than on the people who do take them.” (In amplification of the Timothy Leary quote that these substances often cause psychotic behavior in people who haven’t taken them. NOTE: Leary denied being the source of this quote.) “Science fiction is the gateway drug.” “I spent last week withBruce Damer, who is one of the great mavens of interactive, virtual worlds, and we were dressing in avatars,meeting people in cyberspace(see photos, right) … and then opening several virtual worlds at once on your screen. So you actually have the experience of being in more than one place at one time. After a couple of hours of that you leave the keyboard, and you can practically feel the McLuhanesque reprogramming of your communications-based categories based on this bizarre informational environment that you’ve been spending time in.” “Drugs are here to stay. They’re a part of post-modern life. There will be more and more of them. Wherever they are illegal they will spawn criminal syndicalism. We need to sit down with our children and explain to them how you take drugs, how you evaluate their effect on you, how you make decisions absent social pressure and hype and how you come to terms with this particular aspect of modern life. … If we don’t educate people we are going to produce a continuous supply of victims for the courts and the prisons to make their grist.” “I’m not interested in cataloging the varieties of the doorways to the secret. I’m interested in finding one doorway that works.” “Pro bono proctologists from other star systems are not making unannounced, free house calls in our homes. This could almost be a litmus test for sanity.” “Whether achieved through some yogic or some quasi-religious technique or through the use of drugs, but when we perturb our mental machinery time and space comes apart and reweaves itself in unexpected ways.” “It’s very interesting to me that this psychedelic insight [that we are creatures of language] is restated by the cyber revolution, which says it slightly differently. It says the world is code. Everything is code. Your DNA creates you as its code unfolds. … Code is the primary reality.” “I’ve always felt in a way that the New Age was a flight from the psychedelic experience, that the New Age was saying its invisible agenda was ‘We’ll try anything as long as we’re sure it doesn’t work,’ and that automatically exempts psychedelics.” “Once you find psychedelics you’re not looking for the accelerator anymore. You’re looking for the brakes on your spiritual vehicle. You have suddenly found the means to achieve the stated goal, which is union with the divine, or oneness, or something like that.” “Magic, which we haven’t heard much about seriously, since the sixteenth century, magic is the idea that the world is made of language, and that you can control the world through language, through spells, through the power of letters, so forth and so on.” “Computer code is magical language. It’s language which when executed causes something to actually happen.” “So I would say on this 2012 thing, we can now see the light at the end of the tunnel. Human history ends in human-machine prosthesis, and machine history begins in human-machine prosthesis.” “Drug-taking and drug-using people have been hideously stereotyped. If a racial or religious minority had had to put up with the crap we’ve had to put up with we would have gotten some kind of remediation from the Justice Department.” “You know, the dirty little secret of Northern California’s vast economic success down at Silicon Valley is the creativity that was injected into this area in the 1960s through the LSD revolution. In many, many significant cases it’s the same people.” “Where do the ideas come from? You know, people who don’t take psychedelics think it’s all moving lights and little concentric circles. They don’t understand that these are tremendously emotionally moving dramatic scenarios that one could not possibly generate out of one’s mind.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option ALSO SEE:“The Virtual AllChemical Powwow” for Terence Mckenna at his house in Hawaii on February 25th 1999 Erik Davis’ Interview of Bruce Damer for Wired Magazine feature about Terence McKenna Forum on KQED with Michael Krasny"

One of the reasons I think it might be interesting for you to hear this conversation is to get a feel for what it was like to hang around with the bard McKenna. While you might think that he did most of the talking, you will find that the opposite is true, and much like Aldous Huxley, Terence did a lot of questioning and listening.

And, of course, what you end up doing is you end up reading scholars of mysticism.” “To me it’s the most psychedelic part of the psychedelic experience, it’s when you get the logos coming out of the trees, the rocks, the berries, the water, everything.” “[Speaking about how to pursue a psychedelic culture.] Well, I’d say the wrongly-packaged version would be something like ‘Castenadaism’, a formulaic cult. Do these things, take these drugs, follow these instructions and moral obligation will flee from your kin. Nobody can be that foolish. If, on the other hand, you sincerely pursue this stuff, grow the plants, try to understand it, try to revivify the rituals and figuring out what it’s all about, well, that’s an authentic push towards spirituality, a very authentic push towards spirituality, and probably fruitful.” “It seems to me that ‘the shamanic drug of the month’ is not a very appealing idea.” “The basic concept [of alchemy] is that somehow intuition and nature are reflective of each other. Until that hypothesis fails we should probably hang on to it, because look how far we’ve gotten. I mean it is really bizarre how much of nature the human mind seems to be able to understand.” “[I’m hoping] that some lack of resource or vision doesn’t reveal that we can’t give enough people a bearable life. So we [would then] have to live forward into an age of revolution, social turmoil, and struggle for resources. It doesn’t have to be this way.” “Now let’s see if information can liberate. That’s why I don’t want to do something stupid like die and miss the whole unfoldment of this proposition that knowledge is power, information will liberate. And it will be settled in the next ten or fifteen years. Either they’ll get a handle on it, whoever ‘they’ are, whatever a ‘handle means. Or it will slip from their control, and it will be clear that some kind of dialogue is now going on between individual human beings and the sum total of human knowledge, and that nothing can stop it, that some kind of Renaissance, some kind of total new relationship to knowledge and possibility is put in place.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option This isErik Davis‘ account of the interview heard in this podcast. Excerpt:The following are excerpts from interviews that I conducted with Terence McKenna in late October and early November of 1999, in preparation for a profile that appeared in the May 2000 issue of Wired. These interviews have also been edited and released on a CD,Terence McKenna: The Last Interview. Given McKenna’s subsequent demise, I chose selections concerning his feelings about death and dying. The October interview was conducted in San Francisco just a few days before Terence underwent a craniotomy, and he therefore spoke a bit more frankly about his condition than during November, when I spent a week with him and his wonderful girlfriend Christie Silness during his sort-of recovery in Hawaii."

I think what is done is so much more powerful than anybody recognizes.”–Ram Das “I see all this destruction as just the process of transformation. The question is whether we’ll keep it together in the process of transformation.”–Ram Das “So I really see the psychedelics as directly intervening in the core process, which is running us over the edge, which is our inability to connect with the consequences of what we’re doing.”–Ram Das [Speaking of the Sixties:“The fact that they noticed us was because we were busy making statements, instead of just being it.”–Ram Das [McKenna]“So it isn’t enough to just say, the system will take care of itself?”[Ram Das]“Well I am part of the system that is taking care of itself.” “I lead a continuous paradox that suffering stinks and suffering’s great.

No hallucinogenic insect has ever been found, and yet there are persistent rumors in different parts of the world of either a butterfly or a beetle that is hallucinogenic.” “As to why [psychoactive plants] have this peculiar effect that they do in us, I think that’s because there was, anciently, and over the evolutionary life of human beings, actually a connection between us and nature. And that these drugs are the antenna, the switches that switch us back toward the Logos of the natural world.” “This is something people don’t realize, flowering plants are as recent as mammals.

And I think in that sense the Occupy Movement is, in sort of classical terms, correctly defined as a revolutionary movement.”-Chris Hedges “The legislative branches, both at the state and the federal level, are wholly owned subsidiaries of the corporate state.”-Chris Hedges “But this is a moment, this is more the French Revolution moment.

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More SupportLorenzo on Patreon.com PROGRAM NOTES: The session begins with a discussion about the nature of the Big Bang and its relation to philosophical concepts, specifically Kant’s notion of space as an a priori function of consciousness. Terence questions the traditional metaphor of the Big Bang as an explosion in empty space and suggests a more accurate understanding as the creation of time, space, and matter simultaneously. They argue that this event is highly improbable and that science’s request for belief in such an event is akin to asking for a miracle.The conversation then shifts to the notion of the universe as a process of novelty condensation and explores the idea that the universe might be much older than currently believed, possibly around 17.5 billion years. Terence critiques current cosmological theories and highlights issues such as the discovery of stars older than the universe. They suggest that the universe’s true age and nature might be significantly different from mainstream scientific consensus, emphasizing the chaotic and competitive nature of scientific research and the limitations of formal systems in generating all true statements within a system.Finally, Terence touches on the evolution of consciousness and language, challenging the idea that speech is a natural human ability. They propose that language, defined broadly as the coordination of details about the present to create a model of the world, predates speech and has deep roots in animal behavior. The discussion includes the role of psychedelics in early human development, particularly how psilocybin may have influenced social, sexual, and cognitive behaviors, leading to the emergence of complex consciousness and culture. The narrative underscores the impact of psychedelics on early human societies and their eventual decline, leading to the development of agriculture, hierarchy, and modern civilization.SUGGESTED READING:The Spirit of the Internet: Speculations on the Evolution of Global Consciousness(Free PDF copy)"

So now I see that the spectrum of human experience is a lot broader than I previously imagined.” “The mind can adjust to a great deal more than that which simply kills it.” “Given how weird life has been, why rush to prejudge death. It’s bound to be mighty strange, life was mighty strange, and I’m curious. … It’s an interesting situation to be told that you have a very limited amount of life left, because it composes your mind for you, wonderfully.” “What psychedelics show is that the world is full of surprises.

And a culture cannot evolve any faster than its language evolves, because what cannot be said cannot be done. What cannot be said cannot be put in place.” “So in a way, one way of thinking about psychedelics is that they empower language. It’s a way to force the evolution of language. The way you stretch the envelope of culture is by creating language.” “It was very important, I think, to the Establishment to suppress that [hip phrases from the Hippie culture], because new words are the beginnings of new realities.” “What holds us together is what holds all sub-cultures together, which is an experience. In this case, the experience of being loaded, and, you know, it’s a very powerful and immediate kind of experience.” “It’s amazing that the world has evolved as far and as fast as it has, the human world, glued together by nothing more than small mouth noises.” “The whole history of the evolution of the Western mind is in a sense the birth of the Logos. The Logos is making its way towards self-expression, and it’s doing this by claiming dimension, after dimension of manifestation.” “The mind is not a form of intelligence. The mind is the theater in which intelligence is manifested. You don’t want to confuse the garage with the car. … Everything goes on within the confines of mind. It’s like the light that you switch on when you walk into a darkened room, and then everything else is the furniture within the room. Mind is simply the light which is shed over the landscape of appearances. … Mind is the inclusive category, I think.” “It’s very important to try and make some accommodation to the local language, because in a way, only the local language is appropriate to the place. … Somehow the local language is a part of the local reality.” “The one thing you learn taking psychedelics is that nothing is straightforward.” “Anybody who starts talking to you about the grandeur that was Rome, should be reminded: The grandeur of Rome was it was a bargain-basement on three floors masquerading as a military brothel. It was not a great civilization.” “I’m completely convinced that no one is in control, and that this is very good news.” “In a sense, the flying saucer is nothing more than a modern rebirth of the philosopher’s stone. The flying saucer is the universal panacea at the end of time. It’s the thing which cannot exist, but which does exist, and which if we could obtain it everything would be different.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More Guest speaker:Terence McKenna PROGRAM NOTES: [NOTE: All quotations are byTerence McKenna.] “What I think is going on is that probably language was entertainment long before it was meaning. It’s a kind of tuneless singing.” “Sometime in the last 50,000 years, before 12,000 years ago, a kind of paradise came into existence, a situation in which men and women, parents and children, people and animals, human institutions and the land, all were in dynamic balance. And not in any primitive sense at all. Language was fully developed. Poetry may have been at its climax. Dance, magic, poetics, altruism, philosophy, there’s no reason to think that these things were not practiced as adroitly as we practice them today. And it was under the boundary-dissolving influence of psilocybin.” “All the accoutrements that distinguish us from animal existence were put in place when we had a different kind of mind than we have now. We didn’t have a mind that favored role specialization, and male dominance, and anxiety over female sexual activity related to feelings of male ownership. That all came later.” “What history is, essentially, is a careening, out-of-control effort to find our way back to this state of primordial balance.” “We were essentially torn from the Gaian womb, thrust into the birth canal of history, and expelled sometime around the fall of the Roman Empire into the cold hard world of modern science, existentialism and all the rest of it.” “All of them, if you generalized, what these substances do is they dissolve boundaries. They dissolve boundaries. … Now, the reason this provokes a lot of social anxiety is because all societies are about the maintenance of boundaries.” “The Germans take quite a knock for the holocaust, but the Catholic church manages to push more people into death, disease, and degradation every year than the holocaust managed in its entire show. And it’s thought rather crass to even mention the fact. It seems to me that as long as these Catholic bishops can show their face in public that we are in complicity with mass murder.” “We need a pharmacological intervention on anti-social behavior or we are not going to get hold of our dilemma.” “There has been no progress in 60,000 years in reducing the psychedelic experience to a known quantity. It is as terrifying, as awesome, as ecstatic, as irreducible to us as it was to them.” “I believe that what makes the psychedelic experience so central is that it is a connection into a larger modality of organization on the planet, which is a fancy way of saying it connects you up to the mind of Nature Herself.” “I think ideology is toxic, all ideology. It’s not that there are good ones and bad ones. All ideology is toxic, because ideology is a kind of insult to the gift of human free thinking.” “The only difference between a drug and a computer is that one is slightly too large to swallow. … And our best people are working on that problem, even as we speak.” “I do not think that the government, under the guise of some phony, alarmist, pseudo-scientific rhetoric, should attempt to control the evolution of consciousness. After all, if these things truly are consciousness-expanding, it doesn’t take too much intelligence to realize that it is the absence of consciousness that is causing our flirtation with extinction and planetary disaster.” “We don’t want this to end in a toxified garbage pit ruled by Nazis, which is the way we may well be headed.” “It’s inconceivable that Western industrial capitalism could run on another five hundred or a thousand years. It will not continue as it has. It will deteriorate under the pressure of resource scarcity. And what few democratic values we have obtained, what little space for reasoned discourse has been created, will be the first to be swept away. So it’s very, very important that people take back their minds, and that people analyze our dilemma in the context of the entire human story from the descent onto the grassland to our potential destiny as citizens of the galaxy and the universe. We are at a critical turning point.” “So what needs to be done is to spread the idea that anxiety is inappropriate. It’s sort of like we who are psychedelic have to function as sitters for society, because society is going to thrash, and resist, and think it’s dying, and be deluded, and regurgitate unconscious material, and so forth and so on. And the role then, I think, for psychedelic people is to try and spread calm.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

This is the basis of all magic.” “In a Christian context magic is heresy because it implies that man can command god to act. In other words that in some strange way the magician compels nature to behave as the magician desires.” “The Hermetica actually refers to humanity as the brother of god. So it’s a completely different attitude toward being human. It’s an empowering attitude.” “In the hermetical, magical view human beings are not tainted by Original Sin.” “Western civilization, in a way, can be thought of as an accumulated series of misunderstandings.” “Had Western Europe stayed in touch with the mystery religions of ancient Greece, Christianity would never have been able to force its agenda to the degree that it did.” “Alchemy, and conjuration, and tailsmanic magic, and sympathetic magic, all of these things flourished, really, not as a throwback but as a kind of prelude to modern science. Modern science is an incredibly demonic enterprise.” “[John] Dee is the last person to be able to unify into one world view science, and mathematics, and magic, and astrology all together.” “Paracelsus was an interesting guy. He’s essentially the inventor of drugs because he was the first person extract herbs and to get this notion of the essence.” Today’s podcast begins a newly uncovered lecture by Terence McKenna. His topic is “Hermeticism and Alchemy” and he begins this 1991 workshop in fine form, making statements such as: “Human beings are co-partners with deity in the project of being. This is the basis of all magic.” And, “Western civilization, in a way, can be thought of as an accumulated series of misunderstandings.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

We [the psychedelic community] don’t bother with our political processes.” “What we have to do is stop looking for leadership from the top, because the least among us makes their way into those positions of power. I mean, you can see that now [1992], those guys are not fit to throw guts down to a bear … ANY OF THEM!” “What we have to do is knock off this fantasy of being citizens inside a democratic state. I mean, what we are are the propagandized masses inside a Fascist dictatorship.” “Know your enemy and they probably will not be your enemy.” “I think that the Third Reich was a Sunday school picnic compared to the population policies of the Roman Catholic Church. … In a civilized political environment those people would be placed under immediate arrest.” “The way to gain power is to reclaim a command of history.” “And so it’s up to the creativity of ordinary people, and the strongest weapon to support and augment the creativity of ordinary people is the psychedelic experience, because it allows you to put information together in new and exciting ways. And this is to be then the basis of a new political order. It has to be.” “The model of human nature which this society has deified makes it a pathological act, a sin, and a crime to alter your own consciousness. This doesn’t make any sense.

The great Venosa left his body on Tuesday August 9, 2011 at 6:56 PM. His transition was graceful and accomplished in the same composed and calm manner that he exuded throughout his life. I feel honored to have been able to accompany him to the gate, having walked 30 beautiful years together in this life. Robert had a long and brave healing journey with cancer and showed incredible strength on this path as well as tremendous courage in facing this great dragon. He believed in the natural healing ability of the human body and proved the doctors wrong time and again, who only gave him a few month’s to live upon his diagnosis over eight years ago. He was a powerful human being. Together he and I, held the piece of his physical struggle safely tucked away from the eyes of the world like a precious pearl. It is with great sadness that I’m sharing this news today but also withdeep gratitude, for his magical and special life; fully lived. Even in death he gave those surrounding him a powerful initiation into the scared mysteries of the unknown. We will carry him in our hearts forever, remembering the light he shone on so many. He so appreciated the light that others shone upon him. In loving memory of my great love, compañero, best friend and artistic accomplice. Martina Hoffmann and family PROGRAM NOTES: [NOTE: All quotations are byDennis McKenna.] “I think that ayahuasca is actually much more controllable than mushrooms. . . . I think that it is quite an amazing tool for self-understanding and for exploration. I think that it’s good for you, actually physically and psychologically good for you.” “It’s no different than it ever was. When the Jesuits and the missionaries came to meso-America the first things to go, the first things to be stamped out was the knowledge of the sacred plants and the practice of using the sacred plants.” “I think that Christianity linked with Calvinism has a hard time dealing with what you might call facts of biology, which in another phrase is sex, drugs, and rock ‘n roll. In some ways, life is about sex, drugs, and rock ‘n roll. Biology is about those things.” “All experience is a drug experience. Whether it’s mediated by our own [endogenous] drugs, or whether it’s mediated by substances that we ingest that are found in plants, cognition, consciousness, the working of the brain, it’s all a chemically mediated process. Life itself is a drug experience.” “He [Terence McKenna] will never let a fact get in the way of making a provocative statement. He’s a good story teller, but I think it’s important to remember that they are stories, and that he often makes mistakes in his lectures.” “In that position, a guy who can pack the houses every time, I feel has a larger responsibility to the psychedelic community to refrain from making these completely off-the-wall comments, and to actually tell it like it is, not how he imagines it to be.” “I’m sure that Terence views it as theater. I can’t believe that he takes what he says seriously. I mean, I can tell you that he doesn’t. Much of what he says he says it because it’s going to get a rise out of somebody. He’s always been that way.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option "

I mean it’s like a magnet for screwballs.”[Terence then went on, at great length, to describe his own encounter with a UFO . . . go figure.] “I’ve seen things that violated the laws of physics. I believe the laws of physics can be violated. I believe there may well be extraterrestrials somewhere in the universe.” “My technique, which I recommend to you, is don’t believe anything. If you believe in something, you are automatically precluded from believing its opposite. Therefore you have given up a portion of your freedom, and freedom is the dearest thing we’ve got.” “Probe the edges.” “Psychedelics work. If you think that I’m bullshitting you, go home and take five grams of mushrooms in silent darkness and then we’ll talk. That’s the sine qua non. It’ll work, on demand. I’m not saying, ‘And wait forty years, or purify yourself, or get your aura stitched up, or any of the rest of it. It’ll work. It’ll blow your mind to shreds. It’s real.” “What I’ve decided is that the [DMT] experience is an archetype. It’s the archetype of the circus.” “I think where the dead and the living get together is in the dream time. Australian Aborigines have been trying to tell us this for as long as we would listen.” “The dream state is more like the tryptamine geography than anything else.” “Fairies respond to riddlery. This has to do with this thing about language. And the strange relationship of the Irish to intoxication, faries, and language suggests that here we might have a restrictive gene pool that has somehow indemnified itself in the direction of these peculiar concerns.” “As long as we pursue the destruction of the Earth, and the elaboration of materialist ideology, and the suppression of psychedelic states, and the suppression of the feminine we are going to be alienated, feel abandoned, and operate in an ambiance of rampant pathology.” “The apocalypse is no longer a rumor.

Intelligent people use drugs intelligently, and stupid people are going to abuse drugs the way they abuse everything else. And our function is to raise the level of intelligence. We have to have a program of drug education.”–Timothy Leary “I don’t think there’s any problem with advancing consciousness and becoming more and more aware of the struggle, not with the world, not to convince other people to do anything. The really interesting think is the struggle with the self, and the relation with the self, and there is no end to the improvement that can be done there, the discoveries that can be made.”–Allen Ginsberg [NOTE: The following quotes are all byTerence McKenna.] “To contact the cosmic giggle, to have the flow of casuistry begin to give off synchronistic ripples, whitecaps in the billows of the coincidental ether, if you will. To achieve that, a precondition is a kind of unconsciousness, a kind of drifting, a certain taking-your-eye-off-the-ball, a certain assumptions that things are simpler than they are, almost always precedes what Mircea Eliade called ‘the rupture of plane’ that indicates that there is an archetypal world, an archetypal power behind profane appearances.” –Terence McKenna “It occurs to me that at any given moment, because of the way the planet is as a thing, some percentage of human beings are asleep, always, and many are awake. And so if the world soul is made of the collective consciousness of human beings, then it is never entirely awake. It is never entirely asleep. It exists in some kind of indeterminate zone.” “Technology, or the historical momentum of things, is creating such a bewildering social milieu that the monkey-mind cannot find a simple story, a simple creation myth, or redemption myth, to lay over the crazy, contradictory patchwork of profane techno-consumerist, post McLuanist, electronic, pre-apocalyptic existence.” “I believe that the truth of the matter is far more terrifying [than conspiracy theories]. The real truth that dare not speak itself is that no one is in control. Absolutely no one!” “The global destiny of the [human] species is somehow unfolding with the logic of a dream.” “The carrier of the field of the cosmic giggle in most people’s lives is love. Love is some kind of output which messes with the entropic tendency toward probabilistic behavior in Nature.” “The primary contribution of 20th century thinking, if you will, is to have understood, finally, that information is primary. That this world, this cosmos, this universe, this body and soul are all made of information. … The implication for the digerati is that reality can therefore be hacked.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

He addresses the common question of what happens after this date, suggesting a series of increasingly strange scenarios. A less strange scenario he proposes involves a sudden shift in human behavior where everyone begins to act appropriately, inspired by Buddhist and Taoist principles. McKenna humorously imagines that this might lead people to take off their clothes and go outside, although he admits he can’t predict what would happen beyond that point. Among other things, he says, “I think, in a sense, technology is the the alchemical journey toward the condensation of the soul, and the union of spirit and matter in some kind of hyper-object.”"

And I think this is true of any society. It isn’t an American phenomenon. It’s that if you take psychedelics, whatever you are, you know, Eskimo, Hassidic Rabbi, quantum physicist, you will question your first premises. And you get millions of people questioning the first premises, and then the powers that be become very nervous.” “Cannabis holds many benefits, not necessarily related to its properties as an intoxicant, but as a source of food, lubricants, plastics, fuels, etc. The reason the establishment is so hysterical on the subject of cannabis is because it erodes loyalty to the industrial state.” “This is a heresy for sure, I’m not that fond of LSD.

Not bad advice, I’d say. Codex seraphinianus Hardcover – January 1, 1983 ($650) It may be hard to do, but if you take yourself back to 1988, where you didn’t know what would happen in 2000 or 2012, you can see how appealing the idea of the Timewave was back then. …. he admits that he was “hearing voices” … but, nonetheless, when he goes into his poetic description of the Timewave it seems to me that there is still something about the nature of time that remains undiscovered."

For about fifteen minutes all I could say was, ‘I can’t believe it!’ … This is no drug. It’s magic. It masquerades as a drug. It’s a doorway into another world.” “We’re a society where people jump out of airplanes on weekends because their lives are so boring and empty. Well then, if you think jumping out of an airplane is a thrill to write home about you should try this stuff. No one would jump out of an airplane if they had DMT on their menu.” “I came to feel, and I still sometimes offhandedly refer to it like this, that it [DMT] is secret. It is not a secret. It is THE secret. There is a secret, and this is it. It is the secret that the world is not only not the way you think it is. It’s that the way the world is, is a way that you can’t think it is, because you simply do not have the imaginative capacity to conceive of such overwhelming peculiarity.” “You see, a secret is not something untold. It’s something which can’t be told.” “Without this [the smoked DMT experience] in the picture, half the world is missing.” “What we have discovered in DMT is, literally, a chemical doorway to the bardo.” “One thing psychedelics will do for you, for sure, is to convince you that what’s real is what I call the felt presence of immediate experience. That’s what’s real.” “The biological object is made of time itself as much as it’s made of space and matter.” “I’ve come to see the body as basically the placenta of the soul.” “The Twentieth Century is analogous to the birth canal of human history.” “What’s interesting about DMT is that it occurs naturally in the human brain. We all make it all the time. And so, in a sense, this is not a drug at all. This is a human metabolite that you’re getting a tremendous of, but the fact that it occurs naturally in the human brain means that you have chemical pathways, bio synthetic pathways, that can deal with it.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

And things normally experienced as acoustically experienced becomes visibly beheld, and it’s quite spectacular.” “It’s [ayahuasca] essentially ‘brain soup’. There’s nothing in it which doesn’t occur naturally in human neuro-metabolism.” “It’s [ayahuasca] the only hallucinogen I know, where if it’s made right, the next day, or the day after the experience, you actually feel better than if you hadn’t done it.” “What it [the ayahuasca experience] is is a self-generated, self-controlled immersion in a non-causal, parallel construct of some sort.” “This is the key. If you get into deep water with these substances, this is true of psilocybin as well, you don’t want to clench, you don’t want to assume the fetal position and stop breathing.

You can take control of your situation … most of the time.” “In the silence, in the darkness, swept away by these alien alkaloids and the plant-mind behind them, you find out a truth that can barely be told. And most of it can’t be told.” “Ayahuasca loves to take prideful people and rub their nose in it. I mean it can make you beg for mercy like nothing.

Shamanism is how religion was practiced for its first million years. Up until about 12,000 years ago there was no other form of religion on this planet. That was how people attained some kind of access to the sacred.” “Thesine qua nonfor obtaining a psychedelic experience is humbling yourself to the point where you admit that you must submit to the experience of the plant or the drug. This act of surrender is the major technical function you will be called upon to perform during the psychedelic trip.” “Cultural conditioning is like bad software. Over and over it’s diddled with and re-written so that it can just run on the next attempt. But there is cultural hardware, and it’s that cultural hardware, otherwise known as authentic being, that we are propelled toward by the example of the shaman and the techniques of the shaman. … Shamanism therefore is a call to authenticity.” “The same organizational principles which called us forth into self-reflection have called forth self-reflection out of the planet itself. And the problem then is for us to suspect this, act on our suspicion, and be good detectives, and track down the spirit in its lair. And this is what shamans are doing. They are hunters of spirit.” “I don’t believe that shamanism without hallucinogens is authentic shamanism or comfortable shamanism.” “Don’t diddle the dose. Once you have done your homework, go for it.” [NOTE: The following quotes are byMatt Pallamary.] “I’ve gone through some really dark places, and I’ve done that so other people don’t have to do that.” “One of the underlying themes about ‘Spirit Matters’ is that it’s a map, and it’s a guide, and I’m way out on point.” “Altered states of consciousness are fascinating, and they are a part of life and part of experience, and they’re here for a reason.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option MATT PALLAMARY: Author, Writing Teacher, Shamanic Explorer MYSTIC INK PUBLISHING"

The discussion also touches upon the role of heresy in intellectual and cultural progress, with specific examples like Giordano Bruno’s discovery of the infinity of the universe and the impact of gnosticism on early Christianity.Among interesting revelations, Terence talks about his boyhood dream of moving to New York and becoming a famous avant guarde artist. While he never excelled at the visual arts, I think that it is fair to say the art that Terence McKenna practiced was one of a kind.

While mathematicians will more fully understand some of these concepts, Ralph has a way of explaining them so we can all grok what he explains. The concept of using mathematical models for things like tracking hurricanes is common to most of us, ideas about modeling society may be new to many of us, and exciting as well. If ever there was a time to project the track of our culture’s future, this is it. Ralph Abraham’s recent book, Schims, is an excellent companion to this conversation.

Since the three of us are long-time friends who have shared quite a few experiences together, the conversation sometimes turned to us telling a few of our old “war stories.” Two of Jacques’ stories really stand out. As it turned out, Jacques was the last person for whom Terence McKenna ever held a DMT pipe. And then there is the story of how Jacques wound up spending a rainy night all alone in Terence’s house in Hawaii just after he helped pack the library for shipment to the states. The only things that were left in the room where he spent the night was a backpack that had some DMT in it and an urn on the mantle the contained Terence McKenna’s ashes. The story gets quite interesting from there."

The interview begins, like most of the 1980s era McKenna interviews, with a detailed question about DMT, but Elizabeth quickly gets them on a more interesting track. And the reason that I say “more interesting” is because here in the salon we’ve already covered most of the nuts and bolts of various psychedelic experiences. It’s the reasons that draw us to these substances that I find to be the most interesting. When choosing a new psychedelic experience, Terence suggests asking three questions about the substance you are considering: 1) does it have a shamanic history; 2) does it occure in the tissue of a plant or animal; and 3) does it bear a simularity with compounds in our brains.

In today’s podcast we listen in on a live salon conversation with author Erik Davis, who is an author, podcaster, award-winning journalist, and popular speaker. Erik was also instrumental in establishing the Palenque Norte Lectures at Burning Man, which eventually led to these podcasts from the Psychedelic Salon. In 1999, Terence McKenna first brought Erik to my attention, and it has been a fascinating intellectual ride for me to follow his work since then. In this conversation, among several other topics, Erik talks about his new book, High Weirdness, which explores the work of Robert Anton Wilson, Phillip K. Dick, and Terence McKenna as they strode through the 60s, 70s, and into our future. DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option Paul Krassner "

History seems to be becoming more and more psychedelic.” “We have all made too many sacrifices in the name of fitting ourselves into the culture we find around us through the circumstances of our destiny.” “[Culture is a] toxic environment that one needs to negotiate with great care.” “Domestication and civilization are curiously intertwined concepts.” “A society has to be incredibly confident of its first premises to allow its citizens to habitually and regularly explore altered states of consciousness.” “The entire Internet- computer-revolution rides on the backs of people who were taking LSD in the Sixties. People have expressed horror at this idea and then taken opinion polls at various professional gatherings, such as Sigraph and Comdex, and gatherings like that, and have this insight confirmed overwhelmingly. The entire post-1950s edifice of information transfer and replication technology was created by psychedelic people, and it’s serving them very well, as well as the corporate elite.” “Only the expansive, the generous, the psychedelic are going to be left standing when all of this stuff is sorted out, if it is ever sorted out.” “The shaman is the one who is allowed to know how the culture is wired under the board. Everyone else stands out bathed in the glow of the big screen of cultural values, but the shaman are the people who actually understand the reasons for these performances, myths, and rituals.” “We are trying to build, not a class of shamans but a shamanic culture. In other words a culture, and I think there has never been a culture of this type on the planet, a culture that actually lived in the light of the fourth dimension.” “No human being has greater insight into your circumstance than you do.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

There is no communication, even within the confines of your own mind, if you can’t describe what’s going on.” “The crisis we’re in, as a planetary society, is a culture of consciousness. There ain’t enough of it. That’s what happens when women are raped in Bosnia. That’s a failure of consciousness. That’s what happens when rivers are polluted with DDT. It’s a failure of consciousness.” “The idea that art should save humanity is very out of fashion in the cynical ’90s.” “When Fascism comes to America it will be called traditionalism. That seems to be how it’s going to present itself.” “Dancing your ass off in a noisy environment is a perfect strategy for clearing your system of a drug.” “Your SELF is the instrument for the exploration of these dimensions.” “Ideology is fairly absent in shamanism at a practical level. It’s basically about experience, not about an ideological preconception.” “What if there is actually something that survives bodily death, that actually continues to exist in a dimension which we would have to call mental, or trans-real. And what-if you could come and go from that dimension using shamanic techniques? That is what in fact shamanism has always claimed to anyone who would listen.” “What is language? It’s a strategy for escaping from the narrowness of the present moment.” “I think that, well, frankly, I don’t know what I think.

And the thing to give back is share your art, share your soul. The reason we are so controlled, and abused, and misused by our institutions is because we are divided from each other. They have divided us by race, by class, by sex, by political style, all of these ways.” “I’ll tell you straight out, I’m an anarchist. I am an absolute anarchist. I believe in people more than in abstractions of institutions. I will always rely on people.” “You cannot be a public figure and a practicing alchemist.” “The basic notion here, I think, is an idea of radical freedom. This is not a cult of Terence McKenna. It is not a drug cult. It’s a cult of curiosity if it’s a cult of anything. And what you’re supposed to understand when you come out of here is that an open mind is a very precious thing, and it should never be given away, perhaps ever, but certainly never lightly.” “Belief is toxic.

The people who run these fancy computer companies, and the World Wide Web, and the Net, and CERN, and all that, they’re all freaks.

But the great bulk of creative work in society and those areas is being done by people who took psychedelics.” “On psychedelics essentially you feel, or you see, the morphogenetic field that surrounds objects.” “Clearly we have become a toxic drag on the rest of nature.” “What the New World Order is is a Corporate Order.” “The best substitute for psychedelics, which takes a lot more time, energy, and dedication, is penny-less travel in Asian countries.” “If I had to say one thing that DMT is, it’s alien beauty.” “I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that at the peak of a psychedelic experience you see more art in a half an hour than the human race has produced in the last thousand years.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option  Podcast 055 – “Horizon Anarchism” "

So my techniques are shamanic, but my method is rational and analytical. So I use shamanic techniques to go into shamanic places and then attempt to study them scientifically using reason.” “To me, the New Age is typified by an incredible credulity and an utter immunity to cognitive dissonance.” “What I have done is I probe weirdness, but rationally. Most people who are attracted to weirdness want to convert, and believe it, and take it in, and exalt it. I don’t. I don’t want to believe anything. I hate ideology, all ideology. That’s why I’m so casual about the possible crushing of my own, because ideologies are a lesser resolution of our dilemma than we are capable of.” “The truth does not require your participation in order to exist. Bullshit does.” “Culture is a flight from reality. ALL culture is a flight from reality.” “Radical human freedom is what you were born for, and culture is a kind of placenta, which if you develop normally by around age twenty you have no need of it, and in fact you’ve recognized the toxic nature of it and are trying to put it behind you and get away from it.” “All this computer revolution is is a shift to more lightweight building materials.” “Enormous doses of fuzzy thought and ideology are usually known as religion. . . . And the claim that you can achieve, somehow, the paradox of being outside without ever leaving culture by using the cultural instrument of religion to make your way to the heart of the mystery. I reject this. I just think think it’s bunk.” “Spiritual thirst can’t be culturally confirming, because it’s a rejection of culture. Culture generates spiritual thirst.” “In the underground, then, an enormous database has been built up. No one knows as much about psychedelics as people in the underground, because they’re the people who have actually taken them, correlated that date, and kept track of it.” “Psychedelics demand of us courage. Every single person who says they’ve done psychedelics several dozen times is a courageous person. You’re standing in the presence of fearlessness, because otherwise people turn away from it.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

All kinds of strange things happen on trips that really happen! It’s not hallucinations. These things really happen. The ordinary laws of causality are obviated, and you become a magnet for the strange, the peculiar.” “In some sense, when you take a plant it takes you. . . . So essentially when you take psilocybin you are experiencing all the previous psilocybin trips that ever were.” “I’m not of the school that says what we need is a drug we don’t have. . . . I think that we have the substances we need. What we don’t have are the techniques and the intelligence to know what to do with them.” “Cannabis is the rudder on your ship.” “In a sense, learning what drugs you should and shouldn’t take is as big a task as deciding what kind of person you should or shouldn’t go to bed with.” “I think if you go through life taking vast amounts of drugs of all sorts then you didn’t quite get it right. The idea is to find what works for you and then put the pedal to the medal. If it’s LSD, or whatever it is, these things have personality. It’s just like making a friendship, and some people are gonna want to be your friend, and some people are going to think you’re a jerk. And you don’t want to hang out with those people because they make you feel bad.” “I don’t believe everything the mushroom tells me. I just treat it like everybody else. You can’t trust anybody one hundred percent.” “I think one of the problems with education is that we are trying to use a print-created institution to educate electronically biased human beings.

I’m against hierarchies, lineages. All assumption of special knowledge on the part of anyone in the presence of anyone else is abhorrent to me. I am a true anarchist, first and foremost.” “The psychedelic mantra: I’ve done it this time!” “And yet, the DMT thing, it’s like and avalanche of orgasmic beauty, but a certain kind of beauty. The only words that I can find for the kind of beauty that it is are bizarre, alien, outlandish, freaky, and at the very edge of what the human mind seems to be able to hold.” “What we are about to discover is probably the least likely thing any of us expected out of our dilemma. What we’re about to discover is that death has no sting. That what you penetrate on DMT is an ecology of human souls in another dimension of some sort.” “I never imagined that a through exploration of life’s mysteries would lead to the conclusion that, in fact, this is but a prelude. We are in a very tiny womb of some sort. Our lives are gestations, and this is not where we are destined to unfold ourselves into what it means to be human. This is some kind of a metamorphic stage, like the pupa of a butterfly, and so this is deep water.” “I think that the human body, the human mind, these are tools for the soul to use in the effort to unlock its meaning and its destiny.” “A drug that you take and forty-eight hours later you’re laying around in warm baths and refusing telephone calls is a drug you shouldn’t have taken.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option  "

The human studies were never done.” “You may have the notion that we are a minority that feels this is important and there is a majority that feels that it’s unimportant. That isn’t the case. We are a minority who feels this is important, and there is a majority that knows nothing about it whatsoever, has no data, and no realization of what it is.” “People such as ourselves, we are the cutting edge of neuro-psychopharmacology, because the content is the frontier, and these scientists know very little about it.” “The official version of what can happen with these hallucinogens is very limited. There was never stress on content. The individual content of the psychedelic trip was treated like the ravings of a psychotic. In other words, it was never examined from the point of view that this person might be a reliable witness.” “What does it mean that the most powerful of all hallucinogens occurs naturally in the human brain?

In addition to many interesting facts that Terence presents about Salvia, he tells how Daniel Siebert became the first person to identify the active ingredient of the plant, which eventually led to its widespread use today. In addition to discussing Salvia, Terence also touches on: Ibogaine, magic mushrooms, psychedelic plants, Australia’s psychoactive plants, DMT, Greek mystery religions, Datura, LSD, War on Drugs, and language. “I’ve not done the pure [salvinorin A] compound. It’s somewhat scary. One thing that’s scary about it is it creates a profound break with reality. The person who is intoxicated totally loses touch with this world, and unlike people on DMT, or ketamine, or some other short-acting psychoactive or dissociative, they won’t stay still. People tend to move around and be active, which is a real pain for the sitter. . . .

What’s being claimed here [in the psychedelic experience] is a technique, and then you figure out your own questions and your own answers. And it’s different for everybody.” “There really is no ideology associated with psychedelics. If you look at the people who’ve been involved with it they’ve said completely different and contradictory things.” “We look askance at the mind the same way that a Victorian nanny is uncomfortable in the presence of ‘bare’ furniture. We fear it and don’t want to look at it. And to my mind, most of the techniques that come out of the New Age are based on a guarantied lack of success. That’s what they offer, because the last thing anyone wants is real change, because real change is uncontrolled change.” “Somehow our inability to get a grip on our global problems has to do with this immaturity about our mental state. The two, I feel very strongly, are linked. Of course we can’t get control of the world because we are children in some profound way.” “The real message, more important even than the psychedelic experience, the real message that I try to leave with people in these weekends is the primacy of direct experience.” “Everything not within your reach is basically unconfirmed rumor.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

It’s being replaced by something else, the world’s one thousand companies, the world corporate state.” “The interesting thing about the world corporate state is it has no real moral agenda. It only wants to pick your pocket, which when you think of what’s been peddled in the ideological market place in the 20th Century, somebody who only wants to pick your pocket is a welcome and humane addition to the rogues gallery. So I think that fairly quickly, more and more drugs will be legalized and even drug taking encouraged because there’s a great deal of money to be made.” “So all of these things [adverse reactions to drugs] should just be treated as neurotic responses to the problem of being, and if people want therapy or anti-depressants, or whatever they want to get over this hump should be given to them. But to criminalize this is not to do any favor to the victims. It’s simply to turn it into a racket for all kinds of underworld and marginal institutions.” “What all these things [psychedelic substances] have in common is that without any great danger to body and mind they produce a profound transformation of consciousness, the processing of language, the way in which we model the world and relate to the past. And do they impact on cultural conditioning? You bet your booties they do, because what they do, essentially, is return you to some primal, per-cultural state of conditioning where the animal body and the unacculturated inputs of perception are directly experienced. This is a model of the psychedelic experience.” “Is culture good or bad? Well, I’m coming slowly to the conclusion that, I’m not sure it’s bad, but it’s certainly a damn nuisance. It’s a limitation, is what it is.” “The problem is these [world] cultures create less than a full expression of human potential.” “To the degree that we are integrated into our culture we are not ourselves.” “Could we end up spending most of our disposable income on code rather than fabricated steel, aluminum, glass, and plastic?” “So it’s going to be technology, or catastrophe, or fascism. These are the choices, because, of course, because fascism, you know, can just order the liquidation of everybody under five feet, or everybody with brown eyes, or whatever. But the consequences of fascism are the complete distortion and subjugation of the human spirit. When we talk about survival of the human species we’re not talking about at-any-cost or under any circumstances.

We have no need of spiritual illusions because we have access to spiritual realities through the substances and the plants.

At eighty what are you still going to be doing, expressing homophobic views, voting Republican, and worrying about the A, B, and C’s of phony reality?

This 1997 talk was given less than three years before Terence’s death and thus represents some of his latest thinking about this topic. He defines the TimeWave as a mathematical model of how the world works, as based upon the I Ching. Also, he clearly states that where the end point is set determines all of the other data points fall. However, in true Terence McKenna fashion he points out that even if he was 0.001% off, that gave him a range of 60,000 years in which his prediction would still be valid. He then goes on to discuss his correction to the Watkins objection that was discussed in podcast 472.

Ken’s right, you feel better the day after than if you hadn’t done it. What [other] drug can you say that of?” “I think this ayahuasca thing is the last living remnant of this kind of way of relating to nature. Because in the heavy ayahuasca-using societies, these people are saturated in this stuff. As Ken says, three times a week. And it’s really changing how they look at the world.” “Isn’t it interesting that the ‘fix’ turns out to be not a drug, but a shifting of the ratios of neurotransmitters already present in the organism, as though we’re just out of tune. We have evolved out of tune. There’s an enzyme problem that has caused us to fail to suppress the ego.” “Psychedelics address this entirely mysterious area. The area of thought and cognition.” “I’ve seen, really, what seemed to me amazing things on psychedelics that must bear on the problem of the genesis and stability of meaning.” “The really important thing that can be done with psychedelics, in a generalized sense, is that they are inspiration for ideas. And when you sail out into the psychedelic dimension you are sailing out onto an ocean of ideas.” “What is human nature in the absolute absence of nature?” “If mind were not constrained by the rules of physics we don’t know what we are. We don’t know the castles we would build in the air.” “I think that the future of humanity must be in the imagination. The imagination is a place. It’s a world. It’s a straw being extended by the overmind to a drowning person. And we somehow have to marshal our wherewithal to march off into the imagination, because it’s the only safe haven there is.” “What we are cannot be unleashed on the surface of a planet without destroying that planet.” “I think, based on the Timewave and based on reading the newspaper, that the great stumbling block now in the formation of a sane, global agenda is religious fundamentalism.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

An interesting feature of this session is a report that Terence asked one of his friends to give about the state of ayahuasca use in Amazonian Peru. As one of the earliest accounts of what a Westerner will encounter when searching for an ayahuasca experience, we get to hear what it was like in the jungle before the plague of ayahuasca tourism took hold. One of the interesting ways in which he describes an ayahuasca vision is this it is a manifestation of one’s own intuition. We also get to hear Terence describe what he calls “tingling-lip ayahuasca”.

Today we continue with a workshop that Terence McKenna led at the Esalen Institute in June of 1989. Although he begins with an exploration of ideas surrounding the use of sound during psychedelic experiences, he also tells some great stories, including one of my favorites. I’d only heard it once before, and for me it’s the funniest story I’ve heard him tell, and this is a new version that you won’t want to miss. Additionally, this may be one of the earliest talks in which Terence addressed the issue of global climate change. Also, for the first time I remember hearing it, Terence talks about his ideas concerning the concept of exo-pheromones.

As he says, “We are very naieve about the nature of time,” pointing out that the concept of using an average of measurements taken in a science experiment requires that all moments of time must be the same. “Are they?” he asks. “Is every moment just like the others?” From there he takes us on an interesting journey into the I Ching. “We get to the point then with modern science where you could almost say that modern science is the art of describing those systems so crude in their structure that they are not subject to temporal variables.”-Terence McKenna “Time is a series of fluctuating variables.”-Terence McKenna DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

If you really want to get out into unknown territory, where there is the potential for danger, then start pouring these things together.” “It’s a funny thing the way people relate to drugs. Many people take them in environments that couldn’t be better designed to suppress the effect of the drug. For instance, crowded singles bars, noisy social environments with everybody hitting on each other, and loud music, and lots of activity, and maybe lots of vigorous dancing. Well, this is an environment designed to suppress drug effects. . . . To really see what these things do, you need and atmosphere of quite, sensory deprived darkness.” “My attitude is always if it’s legal it ain’t gonna work.” “People have trouble saying a lot about many of these things. I think that’s a learned skill; narrative ability and to keep your wits about you in those places, and to try and bring back some kind of coherent metaphor.” “The strange thing about opium is that it’s so endlessly fascinating while it’s happening, and there’s just nothing to be taken out of it. It apparently does not transcript into short term memories.” “It’s as important to tell the trip as to have the trip.” In answer to the question, “How do you regain yourself when having a difficult trip?” Terence answered, “I always have cannabis ready.

Supplementing his recently released book, “Brief Peeks Beyond,” he touches on the so-called hard problem of consciousness faced by materialists. In his examination of the dominant materialistic world view, Bernardo reveals the forces behind our value systems, which in turn determine our behavior. He ends with some very concrete suggestions for five things each of us can do to make the world a little better. However, my favorite section of this talk comes when he suggests that cosmic consciousness at-large may actually be experiencing what we humans call multiple personality disorder.

We also get to hear one of the rare instances where the bard McKenna gives us his opinion about 5MEO-DMT, as contrasted with his primary psychedelic substance of interest, NN-DMT. Going on, he speaks about drugs grown out of cultured amphibian skin, and about ways to enhance certain psychedelics. At one point Terence takes off on what can only be called an anti-Myan rant, something I haven’t heard him say before.

While it is a story that we have heard before in various guises, Terence once again manages to tell his DMT stories in a way that makes it seem like you are hearing it for the first time, and with new detail if that can be imagined. Who else, for example, would describe a DMT trip as feeling like you are a baby in a maternity ward’s playpen. And this was new for me, at one point Terence says that when it comes to DMT, “I like to do it outside on a sunny hillside.” His description of a new delivery method that he was developing for smoked DMT sounds almost medieval. Followers of Terence will find his answer about his health quite revealing. And in regards to machine elves, et al, he says it’s all a lie, but a lie which points toward a truth that cannot be told.

The program begins by picking up with a story about river pirates in the Amazon, migrates to tales of running a bar in the jungle town of Iquitos, Peru that was frequented by DEA agents, and continues with Peter talking about his interactions with luminaries such as Albert Hofmann, Alan Ginsberg, Ken Kesey, Timothy Leary, and Terence McKenna. Also, Peter talks about his new book “Sapo In My Soul”, which is the first book to be published about this interesting medicine. Of interest to our younger saloners will be his telling of how, as a young man himself, he financed his trips to the Amazon and the methods he used to search for medicinal plants in the jungle.

While there was some information about psychoactive plants available in professional journals and university libraries, it took Terence to pull out this information and repackage it for the rest of us. In this June 1989 workshop, he does what he did best back then, give us a detailed inventory, continent by continent, of the psychoactive plants native to each area, along with a brief history of how humans interacted with them in the distant past. [The following quotations are byTerence McKenna.] “We can’t sell short the spiritual power of cannabis, especially when eaten.” “In a way, this is a definition of shamanism.

And the species that is most successful is not the species that can dominate all others, it’s the species that can make itself indispensable to all others.” “Culture, as it is in a sense, the software of the infrastructure of the global civilization, which is the hardware.” “Culture can be redefined as software and radically re-written so that it runs much more smoothly.” “I did not say that we were software or hardware. We are neither. We are the user, and this is the important thing to remember. We are not scripting ourselves into some kind of machine future. We are designing the future that we want to have rather than allowing the blunders of our grandparents to dictate the kind of future we will have.” “To offer instead a potential calendar in celebration of flux, change, growth, and feminism, which are the values that are going to have to be maximized if we are going to open a dialogue with our souls and [the] soul of the planet and save ourselves from the lethal momentum that so many hundreds of years of dominator culture have imparted to the machinery of our civilization. We must awaken.” “The path out of the Dark Wood in which we find ourselves is cognition, thought, getting smart fast.

The plan wants to come to be. We have to get out of the way.” “Life is some kind of opportunity. It’s an opening between unbridgeable chasms of the unknown. And yet, out of chaos, for twenty, forty, seventy years we come into a domain of immense opportunity. It is a conundrum. It is a puzzle. It is something to be figured out.” “The path with heart is the path which astonishes.” “All of our technology is an excretion of the imagination. All of our technology is the condensation of ideological intention.” “My own private opinion about this is, I think that what psychedelics in these high-dose, correct set/setting situations carry us into is an ecology of souls. . . .

When I say boundary dissolution, the real boundaries I’m talking about are the boundaries of dimensionality. The way a shaman is able to do what shamans do is by transcending Newtonian space and time.” “Here’s my model: The mind is like a crystal growing under pressure, and the pressure is the pressure of Newtonian space/time. And so the crystal grows and takes the shape of its confinement. But when you liquefy the crystal matrix with a psychedelic, it has another preferred geometry. And it unfolds into this second geometry. And the second and alternative geometry is more hyper-spacial. Culturally, our minds are confined by cultural pressure and cultural phase-space to reflect cultural concerns. . . . When you take a psychedelic and you dissolve the confinement . . . then it’s like taking [the mind] out of its box, and it can configure itself in a more comfortable geometry, and it’s free.” “In a sense, chess is like good practice for shamanism, because good chess players see deeply into the future.

So this is precisely what these compounds are doing.” “What is always left out of descriptions of the psychedelic state, the deep psychedelic state, is how weird it is.” “I finally realized that this ‘place’ that I kept bursting into [on a psychedelic experience] was somebody’s idea of a playpen.” “We [psychonauts] are all going to go into the books as pioneers, because it’s too early for us to be anything else. There’s no map, no finished database, just anecdotes of the crazy, crazy stuff that goes on. That’s why it’s so important to try and share [our stories].” “The world isn’t this unbelievably strange thing which is ‘out there’. The world is this stranger-than-we-can-suppose thing which begins from the core of us out. That means nothing can be taken for granted. It can be taken apart. It can be put together many, many ways.” “[DMT] is pure, one hundred per-cent magic. MAGIC. It’s not a drug. It’s an event. It’s not something you do. It’s something that happens to you.” McKenna also describes a DMT experience as, “A collision with another modality.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option The Creative Explosion: An Inquiry into the Origins of Art and Religion (Cornell paperbacks) The Botany and Chemistry of Hallucinogens(American Lecture Series)Richard Evans Schultes Plants of the Gods: Their Sacred, Healing, and Hallucinogenic PowersRichard Evans Schultes, Albert Hofmann, Christian Rätsch"

This talk features the artist, experimental film maker, micro-publisher, and media developer, Ken Adams, who for many years was a close friend and neighbor of the late Terence McKenna. You will be delighted with some of the true stories Ken tells as we get to wander with him through the mind of a uniquely creative artist. Also, I tell a couple of my ‘grandfather stories’, and we finish with Ron Shock telling the greatest dope story ever. “We have shared experiences that the entire world knows about, like 9-11 and all the catastrophes in Japan and Haiti and all over the world, the Gulf. We’re being introduced to a level of experience that’s post tribal, post national, where we’re all sharing the same emotional experiences and beginning to develop the persona of a new human being, a human being that’s never been here before. It’s something that’s completely unique in human history.”-Ken Adams DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option  (pay-what-you-can movie download) "

Print imposes a condition on human mind which is now lifting.” “History was an incredibly damaging experience, and now it’s over . . . in a sense.” “What was created by the era of the proper gentleman was excellent table manners and genocide over most of the surface of the planet.” “To me, the psychedelic experience is the experience of trying to make sense of reality.” “If psychedelics are, on any level, to be taken seriously as catalyzers or expanders of consciousness, then we need them, because it’s an absence of consciousness that is making this historical transition so excruciating.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The InternetBy Katie Hafner"

They seem to channel information that is not strictly governed by the laws of normal causality. So that there really is a prophetic dimension, a glimpse of the potential of the far centuries of the future through these compounds.” “Actually, the highest form of human organization is not realized in the democratic individual. It is realized in a dimension none of us have ever penetrated, which is the mind of the species, which is actually the hand at the tiller of history. . . . It is an organized entelechy of some sort, and human history is its signature on the primates.” “I think it’s the sheer power of the hallucinogens that puts people off. You either love them or you hate them, and that’s because they dissolve world views. And if you like the experience of having your entire ontological structure disappear out from under you, if you think that’s a thrill, you’ll probably love psychedelics.” “The leading edge of reality is mind, and mind is the primary substratum of being.” “We can no longer have forbidden areas of the human mind, or cultural machinery. We have taken upon ourselves the acquisition of so much power that we now must understand what we are. We cannot travel much further with the definitions of man that we inherit from the Judeo-Christian tradition.

It cannot be accomplished through a frontal assault upon it by political means.” “Transformation of language through psychedelic drugs is a central factor of the evolution of the social matrix of the rest of the century.”(quote from 1983) “Tribalism is a social form which can exist at any level of technology. It’s a complete illusion to associate it with low levels of technology. It is probably, in fact, a form of social organization second only to the family in its ability to endure.” “I think there is a global commonality of understanding coming into being. And it is not necessarily fostered by institutions.” “If I had to pick an ontological vision that was compatible with what I think these drugs are about, and with what I think is trying to happen, I would pick Taoism.” “So it’s [shamanism] a kind of a profession. It’s almost like clergy.

We are involved in a species-wide crisis, and it’s a crisis of adaptation and intelligence. If we can meet the crisis, if we can re-design the cultural machinery so that it can glide in to the new value systems that a limited Earth, and an electronically activated population demands, then we can use the crisis as a stepping stone to further exploration of the universe, further evolution, further unfolding.” “Nature is an engine for the production of extinct species.” “The contradiction that history confronts us with is a deeper exploration of the psychedelic experience. And the psychedelic experience is something incredibly alien to the Western mind. It is, in fact, taboo.” “The psychedelic experience is not built in to your biology the way orgasm, or sleep, or hunger, or something like that is. It’s a physiological option that involves forming a symbiotic relationship with a plant.” “We seem to be the creature that can download the ideas, the Platonic perfect forms of a higher dimension, into the world of matter. And so where we are there is an interfacing between the world of ordinary nature and some kind of transcendent force.” “Speaking about the unspeakable means stretching the envelop of what can be said. When new things can be said new plans can be laid, new directions can be found out of a crisis.” “Science has steered us deeply into the notion that nature is soulless and spiritless. And the practice of this idea has led us to the brink of catastrophe, global and species and ecological catastrophe.” “Psychedelics are catalysts for the human imagination. That very simply is what they are.” “[Biological] nature is a seamless community of intentionality. Nature is a gene-swarm covering the surface of the planet.” “I believe that shamanism without psychedelics is shamanism on its way to becoming religion.” “So we are like dysfunctional children. Something terrible happened to us in the childhood of our intelligence. We lost our connection to the Gaian matrix, to the goddess mother of the Earth who gives coherency to life, and when the connection was lost we fell into history.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

It’s as much a part of your identity as your sexuality, your ancestral history, or your hopes and fears. And to ignore it is to choose to play with less than a full deck. Don’t do that. Play with a full deck!” “People didn’t care for the Holocaust, that was a moral outrage, but the policies of the Roman Catholic Church push more people into early death, disease, and poverty than the Holocaust ever did. And yet, they’re perfectly free to run their bingo games and appear among us. Why? They should have to answer for this outrage.” “Millions of people right now are being warehoused by television. Television is the heroin of the electrified middle class.” “I think that technology has been obscenely in the service of profit. And science, too, has whored itself to profit. But what kind of world could we build if these things were in the service of art? It’s our cultural values that are out of whack.” “It’s ridiculous to criticize a drug you haven’t taken. It’s sheer, boneheaded, know-nothingism.” “DMT is a reliable method for crossing into a dimension that human beings have debated the existence of for 50,000 years. Is there an invisible, nearby world inhabited by active intelligences with which human beings can communicate? You bet your boots there is. And if you don’t think so, then tell me you don’t think so and you’ve smoked 70 milligrams of DMT. Otherwise we just don’t have anything to talk about.” “Everything has directions. Whether you are ironing your clothes, tuning up your car, or taking psychedelics. If you don’t follow the directions, whose responsibility is it if you screw up? So we have to educate our children, educate ourselves, get these things out of the closet and make them part of the culture. That’s the way to deal with sexuality. That’s the way to deal with drugs. Maturely! “When I think that I will close my hand into a fist, that’s a miracle. That’s mind over matter. No philosopher in human history has ever been able to explain how that simple act takes place. That tells you that philosophy has been staying well-away from the world of direct experience, because every day we experience willing our body to act, and yet we say mind cannot affect matter. Why do we have this contradiction? It’s because we don’t want to admit the primacy of mind.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option Weekend of June 15-17, 2012“Terence McKenna: Beyond 2012” with Bruce Damer and Lorenzo"

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More Guest speaker:Terence McKenna PROGRAM NOTES: [NOTE: All quotations are byTerence McKenna.] “One of the most puzzling things about DMT is that it does not affect your mind. It simply replaces the world 100% with something completely unexpected. But your relationship to that unexpected thing is not one of exaggerated fear, or exaggerated acceptance, as in ‘Oh great, the world has just been replaced by elf machinery. Your reaction is exactly what it would be if it happened to you without DMT. You’re appalled!” “[DMT] is a secret of such magnitude that it’s inconceivable how it has ever been kept.” “When you get to DMT you have hit the main vein.” “It has to do with your own intelligence. Truly stupid people aren’t interested in psychedelics because they can’t figure out what the point of it is. It feeds off intelligence. It’s a consciousness-expanding drug. If you don’t have any consciousness you can’t expand it.” “The less intelligent you are, the less challenging the psychedelic experience becomes because the less capable of entertaining the implications you are.” “A hallucination is a species of reality.” “The world is like a novel. It’s a novel in which you are a character.” “And then I got crossed up with this mushroom, and immediately life became art.” “If what we’re embedded in is a novel, or some work of art like a novel, then what you want to do is figure out who in the novel you are.” “We are trying to find a doorway into a new world for the spirit.” “And I really think that when we dissolve all the boundaries this is what we will discover, is an unconditional caring, an unconditional affection that flows through all life and all matter and gives it meaning.” “You don’t have to wait for the end of the world to get this news. You can just short circuit the collective march toward that realization by accelerating your own microcosm of spirituality through the use of these hallucinogens They are the doorway that the Gaian mind has installed in the historical process to let anybody out, any time they want to, provided they have the courage to turn the knob and walk through the door.” “Let those who talk to the elves find each other and band together.” “We are now in a position to actually make something of ourselves. Extend the design process to human destiny and produce something that will redeem 10,000 years of pogroms, and migrations, and attempted genocides, and pointless wars, and stupid religions that make people hate themselves, and all the rest of it. If we’re going to redeem that legacy then we have to do something quite spectacular.” “A concrescence is a local state of unusually high complexity.” “Organized religion is as concerned with controlling social groups as organized politics is.” “The cost of sanity in this society is a certain level of alienation.” “We all want our children to be well-adjusted, unfortunately there is nothing to be well-adjusted too. So that’s a real problem.” “The reason shamans can do their magic is because they are outside the belief system.” “I think alienation, extra-environmentalism, shamanism, whatever you want to call it, is simply individualism, in the context of cultures that don’t value individualism, and cultures don’t.” “It’s said nature acts to preserve the species. Cultures act to preserve the illusions of the population.” “There are old psychedelicists and bold psychedelicists, but there are no old, bold psychedelicists.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

Pyramid Eclipse, a Symbiosis Gathering RAW week at boingboing.net “A monopoly on the means of communication may define a ruling elite more precisely than the celebrated Marxian formula of monopoly in the means of production.” “An Enlightened Master is ideal only if your goal is to become a Benighted Slave.” “Belief is the death of intelligence.” “Every war results from the struggle for markets and spheres of influence, and every war is sold to the public by professional liars and totally sincere religious maniacs, as a Holy Crusade to save God and Goodness from Satan and Evil.” “Horror is the natural reaction to the last 5,000 years of history.” “Most of our ancestors were not perfect ladies and gentlemen. The majority of them weren’t even mammals.” “Nobody sees the obvious, nobody observes the ordinary. There are more miracles in a square yard of earth than in all the fables of the Church.” “On a planet that increasingly resembles one huge Maximum Security prison, the only intelligent choice is to plan a jail break.” “Only the madman is absolutely sure.” “The Bible tells us to be like God, and then on page after page it describes God as a mass murderer. This may be the single most important key to the political behavior of Western Civilization.” “The border between the Real and the Unreal is not fixed, but just marks the last place where rival gangs of shamans fought each other to a standstill.” “The Right’s view of government and the Left’s view of big business are both correct.” “You are precisely as big as what you love and precisely as small as what you allow to annoy you.” “Of course I’m crazy, but that doesn’t mean I’m wrong.”"

And this has been occluded or obfuscated by the behavioral and statistical and scientific methods that have been brought to bear to study hallucinogenic experience.” “Experientially there is only one religion, and it is shamanism and shamanic ecstasy.” “Shamanism, on the other hand, is this world wide, since Paleolithic-times, tradition which says that you must make your own experience the center piece of any model of the world that you build.” “The content of the dialogue with ‘the Other’ is a content that indicates that man’s horizons are infinitely bright, that death is in fact, well, as Thomas Vaughn put it, ‘the body is the placenta of the soul’” “Alchemy is about the generation of a psychic construct, a wholeness, a thing which has many properties, which is paradoxical, which is both mind and matter, which can do anything.” “Psychedelic drugs, especially psilocybin, allow a searchlight to be thrown on these deeper levels of the psyche, as Jung correctly stated. But it is not a museum of archetypes or psychic constructs, as he seemed to assume. It is a frontier of wholeness into which any person, so motivated and so courageous as to wish to do it, can go and leave the mundane plane far behind.” [Regarding UFO’s]“A history-stopping archetype is being released into the skies of this planet, and if we are not careful it will halt all intellectual inquiry in the same way that the Christos archetype halted intellectual inquiry in the Hellenistic Age.” “But a mature humanity could get into a place where we no longer required these metaphysical spankings from messiahs and flying saucers that come along every thousand years or so to mess up the mess that has been created and try and send people off on another tack. And the way to do this is to look at the abysses that confront man as species and individuals and try to unify them. And I think that psilocybin offers a way out because it allows a dialogue with the overmind. You won’t read about it in “Scientific American” or anywhere else. You will carry it out.” “Escape into the dream. Escape, a key thing charged against these drugs, that they are for escapists. I think the people who make this charge hardly dare dream to what degree they are escapist.” “All information is everywhere. Information that is not here is nowhere.” “We are, in fact, hyperdimentional objects of some sort which cast a shadow into matter, and the shadow in matter is the body. And at death, what happens basically, is that the shadow withdraws, or the thing which cast the shadow withdraws, and metabolism ceases, and matter which had been organized into a dissipative structure in a very localized area, sustaining itself against entropy by cycling material in and degrading it and expelling it, that whole phenomenon ceases, but the thing which ordered it is not affected by that.”[From the point of view of the shamanic tradition.] “In shamanism and certain yogas, Daoist yoga, claim very clearly that the purpose is to familiarize yourself with this after-death body, in life, and then the act of dying will not create confusion in the psyche. You will recognize what is happening. You will know what to do. And you will make the clean break.” “There is not the Newtonian universe deployed throughout the parsecs and kiliocosms of physical space AND the interior mental universe. They are the same thing.” “The tryptamine molecule has this unique property of releasing the structured self into the overself.” “I’m not an abuser. It takes me a long time to assimilate each experience. And I never have lost my respect for it. I mean I really feel dread. It is one of the emotions I always feel as I approach it, because I have no faith that my sails won’t be ripped this time.” “Now your question about the dialogue. I mean this very literally. It speaks to you. You speak to it. It says things.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option July 27 – 29, 2012IONS Retreat Center, Petaluma, California"

[NOTE: All quotations are byTerence McKenna.] “In psilocybin and the tryptamine hallucinogens generally we actually have a state of mind that is very similar to the state of mind reported to accompany the UFO contact, and that these things could somehow be co-mapped, one onto the other” “Involvement with these tryptamines as they accumulated in your system, you seem to acquire the ability to inhabit more than one world at once, as though superimposed over reality there was a super-reality, a hyper dimensional world where information was accessible in magical ways.” “History is just this froth of artifact production that has appeared in the last ten to fifteen thousand years. It spread across the planet very quickly. But that mind in man just goes back and back into the darkness.” “The extraterrestrial is the human over soul in its general and particulate expression on the planet. . . . The over soul is some kind of field that is generated by human beings, but that is not under the control of any institution, any government, and religion. It is actually the most intelligent thing on the planet, and it regulates human culture through the release of ideas out of eternity and into the continuum of history.” “The myths that are building are like the Messianic myths that preceded the appearance of Christ.” “I think that science has betrayed human destiny to some degree. And that we are led to the brink of star-flight, but we’re also led to the brink of thermonuclear holocaust.” “The political conclusion to be drawn is to preserve your freedom of thought by deconditioning yourself to the flying saucer religion before it happens.” “I think that the flying saucer experience is tremendously powerful. And that it really is somehow linked to the psychedelic experience in a way that perhaps will not be understood for some time.” “Well, see what I’m saying is if we would intelligently examine these dimensions that the psychedelic drugs make available, we could as it were get in touch with the over soul and leave the era when man is disciplined by flying saucers and messiahs and progress is halted for millennia at a stretch just because people can’t evolve their ethics and their technology at the same rate of speed.” “The modern epistemological methods are just not up to dealing with an elf, with chattering, elf-infested spaces. I mean, we have a word for those spaces, we call it schizophrenia and slam the door. But, you know, these dimensions have been with us since ten thousand times longer than Freud. And people just have to come to terms with them.” “The discs which haunt the skys of Earth indicate that the unconscious cannot be kept waiting forever. These things are going to have to be dealt with.” “The imagination is the golden pathway to everywhere.” “But I think what’s being missed is that a whole dimension of communication is being ruled inadmissible as evidence simply because it doesn’t conform to the epistemological biases of the people who are asking the question. And that is all these voices in the head that guide shamans, that obsess lunatics, that make poetry, and in other words the muse. The muse is real. . . . Well one could talk endlessly about this subject, I suppose, but until it’s resolved all of man’s epistemological dealings with reality will be haunted by this faint spookiness, which can’t be gotten rid of.” “You see what is happening and why the psychedelic experience is so important is because information is loose on Planet Three. Some kind of very strange thing is going on.” “What is unusual about Earth is that language, literally, has become alive. It has infested matter. It is replicating and defining and building itself. And it is in us.”” “The over mind. The fact that there is a level of hierarchical control being exerted by the human species as a whole. That the destiny of man is not in the hands of governments and corporations and Communist Party apparatchiks. It is in the hands of a weirdly democratic, amebic-like, hyper-intelligent super organism, which is called Everybody.” “And the reality of this informational creature is seen more clearly. It’s an organism. We are having a symbiotic relationship with an organism made of information. And this is what psychedelics reinforces, I think very strongly. It’s in the psychedelic dimension that you finally can key in to the voice of the organism and say, “Hey, what’s happening?” And then it explains to you that things are not as you took them to be at all. And that there is in fact layer, and layer, and layer upon interlocking meaning. And that there’s very little else other than that. And that the imagination is the true ground of being. And that there is a dimension, parallel to time, outside of time that is accessible to you as much as you want it, to the degree that you can decondition yourself from the history-bound cognitive systems that have carried you to that point. This is why it has always been said of psychedelics that they were sociological catalysts.” “What it comes down to is trying to have faith that man is good, because what’s happening is that whatever man is, man is taking control of the definition of being human.” “Man is going to become a mirror of his deepest aspirations, and the question then becomes, “What are man’s deepest aspirations?’” “Death is both a historical and individual phenomenon about which we as monkeys have great anxiety. But what the psychedelic experience seems to be pointing out is that actually the reductionist view of death has missed the point, and that there is something more. It isn’t simple extinction. That the universe does not build up such complex forms as ourselves without conserving them in some astonishing and surprising way that is perhaps related some way to the intuitions that we have from the psychedelic experience.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option Books by Terence McKenna"

Then what becomes the next imperative question?” “People are, in the confines of their own apartments, becoming Magellans of the interior world and reaching out to this alien thing and beginning to map it and bring back stories that can only be compared to the kind of stories that the chroniclers of the New World brought back to Spain at the close of the 15th century.” “Actually, this is what has led us into this extremely alienated state, it’s that we haven’t demanded that the stories we tell ourselves about how the world works confirm our direct experience of how it works.” “In the last eight years we have undergone like a second Neolithic revolution. The first Neolithic revolution was the invention of agriculture. The second Neolithic revolution was the invention of home fungus cultivation.” (from a November 1983 lecture) “I don’t think that mass drug taking is a good idea. But I think that we must have a deputized minority, a shamanic professional class if you will, whose job is to bring ideas out of the deep black water and show them off to the rest of us and perform for our culture some of the cultural functions that shaman perform in pre-literate cultures.” “The word ‘self’ is as great a mystery as the word ‘other’. It’s just a polarity between two mysteries.” “For all we know, we know nothing.” “You have to take seriously the notion that understanding the universe is your responsibility, because the only understanding of the universe that will be useful to you is your understanding.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option Present Shock: When Everything Happens Nowby Douglas Rushkoff Against the Grain[Kindle Edition]Joris-Karl Huysmans (Author)"

They don’t really; there is no degree in shamanism.” “This [repression of psychedelic drugs] has, in my opinion, held back the Western development of understanding consciousness because quite simply, these states, I do not believe, are accessible by any means other than drugs.” “There is an element of risk [in using psychedelics]. I never tell people that there isn’t, but I think that the risk is worth it.” “Psilocybin, tryptamine, is in my opinion the means to eliminating the future by becoming cognizant of the architecture of eternity, which is modulating time and causing history, essentially.” “The immediate future of man lies in the imagination and in seeking the dimension where the imagination can be expressed. The present cultural crisis on the surface of the planet is caused by the fact that this is not a fitting theater for the exercise of imagination. It wrecks the planet. The planet has its own Eco-systemic dynamics, which are not the dynamics of imagination.” “A birth is a death. Everything you treasure, and believe in, and love, and relate to is destroyed for you when you leave the womb. And you are launched into another modality, a modality that perhaps you would not have chosen but that you cannot do anything about.” “There is no knowledge without risk taking.” “It is slowly becoming understood that the modality of being is the modality of mind. “Flying saucers are nothing more than miracles, and they occur essentially to bedevil science.” “The drug may not be toxic, but you may be self-toxic, and you may discover this in the drug experience.” “I think with the work we do with these drugs we are the earliest pioneers in what over the next 100 years will lead to an understanding of consciousness almost as a thing apart from the monkey body and brain.” “We are consciousness. We may not always be monkeys.” So I believe that a technological re-creation of the after-death state is what history pushes toward. And that means a kind of eternal existence where there is an ocean of mind into which one can dissolve and re-form from, but there is also the self, related to the body image but in the imagination. So that we each would become, in a sense, everyone.” “There can be no turning back. We are either going to change in to this cybernetic, hyperdimentional, hallucinogenic angel, or we are going to destroy ourselves. The opportunity for us to be happy hunters and gatherers integrated into the balance of nature, that fell away 15,000 years ago and cannot be recaptured.” “It is the people who are ‘far out’ who are gaining advantage in the evolutionary jostling for efficacious strategies.” “Modernity is a desert, and we are jungle monkeys. And so new evolutionary selective pressures are coming to bear upon the human situation, new ideas are coming to the fore. Psilocybin is a selective filter for this. The wish to go to space is a selective filter for this. Just the wish to know your own mind is a selective filter for this.” “On these matters of specific fact, like is the mushroom an extraterrestrial and that sort of thing, I haven’t the faintest idea. The mushroom itself is such a mercurial, elusive, Zen sort of personality that I never believe a word it says. I simply entertain its notions and try and sort through them, and I found that to be the most enriching approach to it.” “Could any symbol be any more appropriate of the ambiguity of human transformation? What mushroom is it that grows at the end of history? Is it Stropharia cubensis, or is it the creation of Edward Teller? This is an unresolved problem.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option September 27 – 30, 2012On the campus of the University of Pennsylvania"

They seem to channel information that is not strictly governed by the laws of normal causality. So that there really is a prophetic dimension, a glimpse of the potential of the far centuries of the future through these compounds.” “This is the nature of going forward into being: A series of self-transforming ascents of level.” “I believe that the place to search for extraterrestrials is in the psychic dimension.” “It seems to me far more likely that an advanced civilization would communicate inter dimensionally and telepathically.” “There is an angel within the monkey struggling to get free, and this is what the historical crisis is all about.” “It’s possible to see the whole human growth movement of the 1970s as a wish to continue the inward quest without having to put yourself on the line in the way you had to when you took 250 gamma of LSD. And I think all these other methods are efficacious, but I think it’s the sheer power of the hallucinogens that puts people off.” “I think that being imposes some kind of obligation to find out what’s going on.” “The movement of a single atom from one known position to another known position changes an experience from nothing to overwhelming. This means that mind and matter at the quantum mechanical level are all spun together.” “I think there’s a shamanic temperament, which is a person who craves knowledge, knowledge in the Greek sense of gnosis. In other words, knowledge not of the sort where you subscribe to Scientific American, and it validates what you believe, but cosmologies constructed out of immediate experiences that are found to be always applicable.” “I don’t believe that the world is made out of quarks, or electromagnetic waves, or stars, or planets, or any of these things. I believe that the world is made out of language.” “The leading edge of reality is mind, and mind is the primary substratum of being.” “Certainly the central Platonic idea, which is the idea of the ideas, these archetypal forms which stand outside of time is one which is confirmed by the psychedelic experience.” “ Certainly neoPlatonism, Plotinus and Porphyry and that school are psychedelic philosophers. Their idea of an ascending hierarchy of more and more rarefied states is a sophisticated presentation of the shamanic cosmology, which is the cosmology that one experientially discovers when they involve themselves with psychedelics.” “The shaman has access to a superhuman dimension and a superhuman condition, and by being able to do that he affirms the potential for transcendence in all people. He is an exemplar, if you will.” “Skywalker is a direct translation of the word shaman out of the Tungusic, which is where Siberian shamanism comes from. So these heroes that are being instilled in the heart of the culture are shamanic heroes. They control a force which is bigger than everybody and holds the galaxy together.” “I connect the psychedelic dimension to the dimension of inspiration and dream.” “We have changed. We are no longer, as I said, bipedal monkeys.

This talk was given in December 1982[NOTE: All quotations are byTerence McKenna.] “The search for a radio signal from an extraterrestrial source is probably as culture-bound an assumption as to search the galaxy for a good Italian restaurant.” “It is no great accomplishment to hear a voice in the head. The accomplishment is to make sure it is telling you the truth.” “The demons are of many kinds. Some are made of ions, some of mind. The ones of ketamine, you’ll find, stutter often and are blind.” “There is no dignity in the universe unless you meet these things [psychedelics] on your feet. And that means that you have an I/thou relationship, and you say … ‘you’re long on talk, but what can you show me?” “These things [psychedelic medicines] invoke the Logos, which means they work directly on the language centers. So that the important aspect of the experience is the dialogue.” “I think if someone tells you they’ve every drug you know they’re confessing they’re a dilettante. It’s much better to lean hard on a few.” “I think one of the interesting things about judging a drug is to see how eager people are to do it the second time. If they’re eager to do it the second time it’s probably not worth bothering about, because what is necessary to have validity in these experiences is the terror. The terror is a stamp of validity on the experience, because it means this is real.” “Friends, right here and now, one quanta away, there is raging a universe of active intelligence that is trans human, hyper dimensional, and extremely alien.” “The most alien thing in the cosmos is the human soul.” “As nervous systems evolve to higher and higher levels, they become more and more to understand the true situation in which they are embedded.” “As nervous systems evolve to higher and higher levels they become more and more to understand the true situation in which they are embedded. And the true situation in which we are embedded is an organism, an organization of active intelligence that is on a galactic scale.” “In other words, shamanic experience, drug experience, this is ruled out of bounds. And it is because it is the source of novelty. The cutting edge of the ingression of the novel into the plenum of being is happening there. I mean, think about it for a moment. If the human mind does not loom large in the coming history of the human race, then what is to become of us?” “So I am saying we are at the beginning of human thought. This is the birth crisis of intelligence. And intelligence is something which is moving through the higher primates now at greater and greater speed.” “The fact is that the densest organizational material in the universe is the human cortex. And the richest experience in the universe is the experience you’re having right now.” “The testimony that I want to give today is that magic is alive in hyperspace, and you don’t have to believe me or follow me or do anything to validate that except form a relationship with these plant drugs.” “There is some surety that you are dealing with a creature of integrity if you deal with a plant, but the creatures born in the demonic artifice of laboratories have to be dealt with very, very carefully.” “DMT is like an intellectual black hole in that once you know about it, it’s very hard for anyone to understand you when you’re talking about it.” “The future is bound to be psychedelic because the future belongs to the mind.” “The tragedy of our cultural situation is that we have no shamanic tradition. Shamanism is primarily technique, not ritual.” “The only intellectual, or noetic, or spiritual path worth following seems to me to be the one that builds on your own experience.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option TRANSCRIPT OF THIS TALK FROM EROWID.ORG A novel by Lorenzo NOW AVAILABLE AS AN eBOOK Kindle version at Amazon More formats at Smashwords "

A more complete version of this talk may be found inPodcast 317.] [NOTE: All quotations are byTerence McKenna.] “My assumption whenever I am confronted with opposites is to try to unify them, to create a coincidentia oppositorum as was done in alchemy, to not force the system to closure but to try and leave the system open enough so that the differences can resonate and become complimentary rather than antithetical.” “Shamanism, on the other hand [as compared with science], is this world wide, since Paleolithic times, tradition which says that you must make your own experience the centerpiece of any model of the world that you build. No amount of readings from meters, whether they’re metering cyclotrons or any other kind of instrument, are going to satisfy you.” “What psilocybin focuses as a problem that these other hallucinogens do not is that it allows a dialogue with the other that is full of give and take. In other words there are entities in the hallucinogenic world that psilocybin, and DMT, and a few other not well-known or widely distributed plants, hallucinogens, induce.” “Our alienation from ourselves has caused us to set up a number of straw men that are keeping us from building actually a mature model of how the universe really works. The content of the dialogue with the Other is a content that indicates that man’s horizons are infinitely bright.” “Alchemy is about the generation of a psychic construct, a wholeness, a thing which has many properties, which is paradoxical, which is both mind and matter, which can do anything.” “[UFOs are], in other words, something which in order not to alarm us has disguised itself as an extraterrestrial being but is in fact the collectivity of the human psyche signaling a profound historical crisis.” “A mature humanity could get into a place where we no longer required these metaphysical spankings from messiahs and flying saucers that come along every thousand years or so to mess up the mess that has been created and try and send people off on another tack.” “Eternity does not have a temporal existence, even the kind of temporal existence where you say it always existed. It does not have temporal duration of any sort. It is eternity.” “We are not primarily biology with mind emerging as a kind of iridescence, a kind of epiphenomenon at the higher levels of organization of biology. We are in fact hyperdimentional objects of some sort which cast a shadow into matter. And the shadow in matter is the body.” “The whole purpose of shamanism, and of life correctly lived, is to strengthen the soul and strengthen the relationship to the soul, so that this passage [death] can be cleanly made.” “Technology is the real skin of our species.” “There is not the Newtonian universe deployed throughout the parsecs and kiliacosoms of physical space and the interior mental universe. They are the same thing.” “An Aquarian science, or a science that places psychedelic experience at the center of its program of investigation, should move toward a practical realization of the goal of eliminating the barrier between the ego and the overself so that the ego can perceive itself as an expression of the overself.” “This [psilocybin] is a source of gnosis, and the voice of gnosis has been silenced in the Western mind for at least a thousand years.” “We can release this thing once again. The logos can be unleashed once again, and the voice that spoke to Plato and Parmenadies and Hericlitus, that voice can speak again in the minds of modern people. And when it does, the alienation will be ended because we will have become the alien.” “But the main thing about psilocybin, and I stress it over all these other hallucinogens, is information, immense amounts of information.” “Only through the medium of sight can the true modality of this logos be perceived.” “This situation called ‘history’ is totally unique. It will only last for a moment. It began a moment ago. It will only last for a moment. But in that moment there is like this tremendous burst of static as the monkey goes to godhood.” “We, and I, we are intellectuals trapped in a world of too much information. Innocence is gone for us. We cannot expect to cross the rainbow bridge through a good Act of Contrition. That won’t be sufficient. . . . Because to fear death is to not understand what’s going on. And to even see it as a big deal is to not understand what’s going on, although I don’t claim to have reached that exalted plane.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option  Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower’s Guide: A Handbook for Psilocybin EnthusiastsBy O.

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More Guest speaker:Terence McKenna PROGRAM NOTES: [NOTE: All quotations are byTerence McKenna.] “Basically, for me the psychedelic experience was the path to revelation. It actually worked on somebody who thought nothing would work.” “What I like to talk about, and what I have very little competition in terms of talking about, is the content of the psychedelic experience.” “I have a skeptical and cranky side, and I’m forever puzzled why people believe the, seeming to me, dumb things that they choose to believe.” “Psychedelics are actually a kind of miraculous reality that can stand the test of objective examination.” “Actually, these things [psychedelics] reveal scenarios, modalities hierophanies of emotional and poetic power that are very emotionally moving, and sometimes leave in their wake powerful ideas, ideas as powerful as any of the ideas that have moved and shaped civilization.” “The good news about psychedelics is that they are incredibly democratic. Even the clueless can be swept along if the dose is sufficient.” “History, call it 15,000 or 25,000 years of duration, is the story of an animal, some kind of complex animal, becoming conscious.” “One has attained a very fortunate incarnation, I think, to be in a culture, in a place, in a time when psychedelic knowledge is available.” “The reason for the emphasis on shamanism and on other techniques is, you will need techniques if you go into the deep water. And they can make your life very simple and save you from unnecessary suffering. Not all suffering is necessary. Maybe no suffering is necessary.” “The thing that is so powerful about the psychedelics is that they perform on demand, which almost in principle you cannot expect of a mystical experience because that would be essentially man ordering God at man’s whim, which is not how it’s supposed to work.” “Part of what the psychedelic point of view represents is living a certain portion of your life without answers. Just accepting that certain dilemmas will never resolve themselves into some kind of a complete answer. That’s why psychedelics are so different from any system being sold, from one of the great elder systems like Christianity, to the latest cult out of Los Angeles.” “So part of what being psychedelic means, I think, is relentlessly living with unanswered questions.” “Ecstasy is not simply joy. Ecstasy is an emotion of great complexity that hovers almost on the edge of terror sometimes.” “Once you get to this place on what we might metaphorically call your spiritual quest, once you get to the place where you hear about psychedelics, the issue is no longer then about where is the gas peddle on the spiritual vehicle. The issue suddenly becomes, where is the brake? Because this is the fuel to go where you want to go. This is the power to lift you where you want to be lifted.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option Podcasts ofInto the Valley of Novelty Workshop <style=”text-align: center;”> Weekend of June 15-17, 2012“Terence McKenna: Beyond 2012” with Bruce Damer and Lorenzo"

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More Guest speaker:Terence McKenna PROGRAM NOTES: [NOTE: All quotations are byTerence McKenna.] “There is no catalog of psychedelic effects, and so how does one know what the full spectrum is? It’s a very tricky matter.” “At five dried grams (of magic mushrooms) it’s very easy to invoke a voice, a kind of logos-like phenomenon, which operates as the typical hierophant. It’s the teaching voice. It’s Virgil to Dante. It’s a very large and superior force which takes you by the hand and then narrates the various scenarios that you’re conveyed through. … The trick is to get something out of it and get away clean.” “Human language is a psychic ability. I can make thoughts in your head by simply uttering small mouth noises.” “It is not that culture is evolving. The evolution of culture is an epiphenomenon attendant upon the evolution of language. Language is the part of man which is evolving. Culture carries along. At the present moment we are able to speak 21st centuries ideas to each other, but our culture is carrying along at about the 1950s level.” “We are not going to move into the future until we create that future through language.” “I believe that people have deeper and subtler senses of humor. I think that people have more refined aesthetic sensitivity. I think people have a greater sensitivity to the mysteries of human interaction simply because so much LSD was taken in the Sixties. And these are permanent changes that will not be wiped out.” “We’re very fond of the notion of an ever-expanding sphere of understanding. But has anyone stopped to notice that if you have an ever-expanding sphere of understanding, necessarily the surface volume of the frontier of the unknown becomes larger and larger. It’s like building a bonfire bigger and bigger to convince yourself that there’s an awful lot of darkness.” “You can discover [using psychedelics] actually that the adventure of being is not a cultural adventure. It’s not a societal adventure. It’s a personal adventure, and that this is what you really need to be involved in.” “There is always a low level of mutants in a population, but they are of no consequence as long as the selective parameters remain the same. But when the selective parameters change suddenly these individuals, who were previously masked in the general population, the selective advantage that they have now comes immediately to the fore. And they act very quickly, and critically, to send the evolution of a given species off in a different direction. . . . It’s that the new types were always there but not with any advantage. It’s that the new situation has conferred a sudden advantage on them, and they are moving then into positions of dominance in the population, or the society if we’re talking about human beings. I think that the psychedelic experience is like that at the present level. There is a population of different people in the general population, and as conditions change these people will be seen to have adaptive advantages.” “What the psychedelics really do, I think, is release us from cultural machinery and put you right up against the human essence.” “I think there is a potential for immortality, but it isn’t assured. It is something that comes to the courageous. And somehow in the historical experience we’ve gotten the idea, through orthodox religions, that salvation comes to the subservient, and this is totally wrong. It is more like the Greek ideal of the hero, that if you’re heroic enough once you’re dead you’ll be a god. And I think this is what these things summon us all to.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option Weekend of June 15-17, 2012“Terence McKenna: Beyond 2012”"

These consciousness-expanding agents actually anticipate an end state in the evolution of the human mind. And so they cast enormous reflections back over the historical landscape. It is they which generate religions, and physics, and messianic careers, and outbreaks of great psychic accomplishment and disgrace.” “The immediate future of man lies in the imagination and in seeking the dimension where the imagination can be expressed.” “It is slowly becoming understood that the modality of being is the modality of mind.” “It is not easy to make a career out of taking a psychedelic drug. It is not a thing which mixes well with the politics of any institution.” “I think [taking psychedelic drugs] is very dangerous. I do not tell people that it’s safe because I don’t have the faith that it’s safe. I know what the pharmacological literature says, and it says that it’s safe. That at the doses where these effects occur there can’t possibly be a problem, but this seems to me to be the naivete of materialists, and we shouldn’t be in a hurry to believe them even though it might make us more comfortable to do so. In other words, it’s saying the drug may not be toxic, but you may be self-toxic, and you may discover this in the drug experience.” “I think it’s fine to take drugs for pleasure, but it should be labeled as taking drugs for pleasure. And the high doses of psilocybin that are necessary to elicit entry into these places it requires, as it says in Hamlet, ‘You must screw your courage to the sticking place.'” “I think that the work we do with these drugs we are the earliest pioneers in what over the next hundred years will lead to an understanding of consciousness almost as a thing apart from the monkey body and brain. We are consciousness. We may not always be monkeys.” “There can be no turning back. We are either going to change in to this cybernetic, hyper dimensional, hallucinogenic angel, or we are going to destroy ourselves. The opportunities for us to be happy hunters and gathers integrated into the balance of nature, that fell away 15,000 years ago and cannot be recaptured.” “The entirety of human history has been the story of the monkey becoming the flying saucer. . . . And we, for some strange reason, happen to be living through the final moments of that process right now, and it is a turbulent, chaotic, multidimensional metamorphosis.” “Evil is anything which trivializes a mystery.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

It is a kind of human ability, which is at present submerged in the psyche, contactable only by the shamanic means of journeying into historical hyperspace. In other words, of going into that place where the adumbrations of the future are intense enough that you can have an intimation, at least, of what is to come.” “I think the gradual evolution of language is actually the gradual lifting of the veil that is imposed between ourselves and meaning by the planetary ecology. In other words, the forward thrust of history is actually regulated by the ecology, and it is regulated through control of the evolution of language. Because what you cannot think you cannot do, and where you cannot imagine you cannot steer your culture and go. So I’m proposing on one level that hallucinogens be thought of as social pheromones that regulate the rate at which language develops and therefore regulates the evolution of human culture generally.”“Tribalism is a social form which can exist at any level of technology. It’s a complete illusion to associate it with low levels of technology. It is probably, in fact, a form of social organization second only to the family in its ability to endure.” “This is what magic is. It’s being able to speak in a voice which makes things happen, being able to speak in a voice which causes facts to be beheld by groups of people in a way that has been purged from profane language, for us relegated to poetry and that sort of thing.” “The history of man that you don’t know is what your unconscious is made out of.

And the factor which accelerated the forward evolution of the brain size of this particular primate line was the inclusion of psychedelic plants in the diet, which then fed the tendency toward symbol formation and self-reflection.” “A history of the human race could be written analyzing it not in terms of class struggle or the impact of great personalities but as a shifting set of interactions between sugar, tobacco, opium, caffeine, alcohol, and psychedelics.” “That these foods and drugs and spices, we have subtly overlooked them and taken them for granted. They are regulating human history and individual self-expression, how much you know, how you look, how pure your transmission of your genetic heritage to the next generation, all of these things are being regulated and controlled by these plants.” “Gaia apparently works through the intercession of catalytic compounds that convey revelation, and revelation is then the factor which has historical impact. The people, the messiahs, and the teachers are merely the pipeline for ideas, and the metabolic release of these ideas in the macro environment is being controlled by the plant-animal interaction.” “I think that probably we are the agent of change that Gaia has unleashed upon herself.” “The imagination may be, in fact, a three dimensional slice of a higher dimensional universe that is holding all of this in being and causing it to happen.” “The triumph of Socialism will be the commonality of mind in a capitalist context, that there really will be an ocean of thought that you will swim in and that will be composed of deeper and deeper levels of information.” “You see, what’s going to happen is that the rules of the imagination are going to replace physics.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

It’s an effort by organism to map one dimension larger than itself. So it takes a whole life to do it. A life is an effort to map a ‘something’, and the ‘now’ is the moving edge of the mapping process. You cannot map it instantly, or you would be it. And so what being in time is is experiencing the incremental mapping of this higher order object. And that’s why, hopefully, a long life would give wisdom, because a person would begin to get a whole picture.” “Yes, well I think psilocybin seems to be the great teacher of history. … Because your history gives you the power of your convictions.” “I think, better we should tend our gardens and form brotherhoods and sisterhoods of affinity and realize that the task of transformation is one of a lifetime, our lifetime.” “This is the anguish of the ancestors. This is the sacred trust that must not be betrayed. The pogroms, and the invasions, and the atrocities conducted across history can only be, somehow, redeemed if we, who are the living wavefront of this genetic experience do not fumble the ball. All our ancestors are watching to see how we will do.” “The ‘other’ is just a way of thinking about all of these things that we name spirit, god, demon, void. It’s that there just necessarily is a place off our map. Whenever you have a map it implies the part that is not on the map, and the other, the truly other, lies outside the domain of language. It’s like the unspeakable. All you can do it point at it.” “That’s the challenge. You see, that’s the weird thing about the psychedelics. It is a path, but in a sense it’s the end of the path.

[September 27, 2010 PRESS CONFERENCE UPDATE: Aliens ‘hit our nukes’: They even landed at a Suffolk base, claim airmen Read more:Google News Search UFOs PROGRAM NOTES: “The more serious contenders [for explanations of UFO phenomena] as explanations, I think, fall into three categories. Is it us? Are we being visited? Or is there another tenant in the building that we are unaware of?” “… and there always seem to be loose ends that argue against whatever hypothesis seems currently most attractive. . . . If the contactee will truly tell the unvarnished truth then there will be elements in the story which will make the contactee look like a moron. In other words, the invalidation of the experience is an inimical part of its structure.” “So if the UFO phenomenon is something that is coming from us, then what is it, and what is it for?” “I tend to lean toward the notion that the UFO problem, like many subtle problems, is haunted by our own naivete concerning language.” “There is a curious fuzziness about the most mundane parts of reality when we really attempt to magnify and understand them in the clear light of consciousness.” “To my mind, if the UFO phenomena is something arising out of the super-ego of the human psychic organization, then we should ask why. What is it doing?” “[UFOs] are an antidote to the scientific paradigm that has evolved over the past 400 years and which has led us to the brink of global catastrophe.”“The fact that an idea is preposterous has never held it back from making zealous converts.” “I believe that that is the purpose of the UFO, to inject uncertainty into the male-dominated, paternalistic, rational, solar myth under which we are suffering.” “[Science] is not some meta-theory at whose feet every point of view from astrology to acupressure to channeling need be laid to have the hand of science announce thumbs up or thumbs down.” “What assurance do we have that the several million life forms that we know to exist on this planet all evolved here? Do we have any assurance?” “I think we are discovering in our own psychic structure the potential, the possibility, of a relationship with an intelligent species outside ourselves, and this raises for us all the tensions, all the issues, that accompany an adolescent love affair.” “What is happening on this planet is the self-reflecting genesis of communication for itself. It is language, somehow, that is loose in our species, on our planet, within and without the flying saucer.” “So, communication, which we take astonishingly for granted considering the very basic kinds of needs that we communicate to each other, is actually the great frontier of our spiritual becoming.” “Radical freedom doesn’t mean giving someone the vote. Radical freedom means the right to take over and control our own destiny and the destiny of this planet. Radical freedom means recovering our birthright.” “What would you think if somebody attempted to take your sexuality away from you. In the suppression of the psychedelic experience the masters who make the rules have taken away a major slice of what it is to be a human being.” “We have been robbed of our birthright by the frightened, the constipated, the narrow minded, the stupid, and the afraid. Take back your mind. Take back your mind. That is the message.” “The psychedelic experience is the replay of human history in the individual mind.” “What virtual reality holds out is the possibility that we can create a language where we see what we mean. If we could see what we mean we would have a kind of telepathy.” “Ego is something invented by frightened people 20,000 years ago as a way to suppress women, as a way to suppress sexuality, as a way to suppress the wonder inherent in the world.” “The entire universe of matter is the womb of mind.” “This is why psychedelics are illegal. They don’t care whether people jump out of windows or any of that. They’re not interested in public health. They do not want people to take back their minds.” “We are responsible for ourselves, and we will set the agenda for the human future.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option "

And the real tension is not between matter and spirit, or time and space, the real tension is between information and nonsense.” “As our understanding of the machinery, the genetic machinery that supports organic being deepens, and as our ability to manipulate at the atomic and molecular level also proceeds apace, we are on the brink of the possible emergence of some kind of alien intelligence of a sort we did not anticipate.” “Vast amounts of the world that we call human is already under the control of artificial intelligences, including very vital parts of our political and social dynamo.” “While we’ve been waiting for the Palaidians to descend, or for the Face on Mars to be confirmed, all the machines around us, the cybernetic devices around us in the past ten years have quietly crossed the threshold into telepathy.” “[Artificial intelligence,] this most bizzare and most unexpected of all companions to our historical journey is now, if not already in existence, then certainly in gestation.” “Time is defined by how much goes on in a given moment, and we’re learning how to push tetraflops of operations into a given second.” “Surely in a hundred years, a thousand years, a million years we, if we exist, will be utterly unrecognizeable to ourselves, and we will probably still be worried about preserving and enhancing the quality of human values.” [NOTE: The following quotations are byRalph Abraham.] “The very fact that we are at a hinge of history means that what we say and think, even individually, matters enormously in the long run. That’s the teaching, if there is any, of chaos theory.” “In the creation of societies it was altruism, essentially, that was involved in going from where we were to where we are, and it could well be that without love, for example, further evolution is impossible.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

In other words, we have become a menace not only to ourselves but to the planet.” “Civilization is a ten thousand year dash to space with the potential to destroy yourselves. History is the departure of a species for the stars, but it takes ten to fifteen thousand years, a moment of biological and geological time.” “We are creatures of information and the imagination. The monkey we are already beginning to transform and shed. We don’t look like the other monkeys, and we look less like them all the time.” “Humanness may not even be a monkey quality. It may be something that was synergized in the monkeys but that has an inner life of its own.” “So we have become a toxic force in planetary biology. We feel it, and the planet feels it.” “Our imagination is really the sail of the soul, and the question is, where will that sail take us if we will but let it?” “That’s why we are so riddled with apocalyptic mythology, because we really do have a prescience about what is going to happen to us. We really do sense at a very deep level that the linear extrapolation of our historical and cultural tenancies does not give a true picture of the future. That the major factor which will shape the future is uncertainty.” “We have had for some time now the concept of the collective unconscious but we need now to think in terms of the collective consciousness of the race, which is not passive, it’s not just the storage place of old memories and myths and that kind of thing. It is more like an entelechy, it guides, it opens avenues to certain choices and precludes avenues to other choices.” “One of the most puzzling things about psychedelic drugs is trying to teach people how to invoke the modality. People have the attitude toward drugs that if you take them they will work, and this is not true at all, especially with drugs where a modality like mind is what you’re attempting to conjure.” “I think that hallucinogens are basic to humanness and always have been.” “So it may be that humanness is a symbiotic relationship between certain plants and certain monkeys, and that you don’t have humanness unless you have the plants and the monkeys together. This is why we may be the heirs of an inhuman culture.” “And this is what the psychedelic experience is providing, it’s providing a reference point for the production of new metaphor.” “The word psychedelic has been attached to the drugs and confined, but many things are psychedelic. Anything which expands, adumbrates, aids, and supports consciousness is psychedelic if we take the word down to its Greek roots.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More Guest speakers:Terence McKenna, Stanley Krippner, and Andrew Weil PROGRAM NOTES: The Albert Hofmann Foundation (online) [NOTE: The following quotations are byTerence McKenna.] “What is the psychedelic experience? What promise does it hold for a sane future for our planet and our children? And what is it about it that kindles the kind of loyalty that I feel coming from the people in this room this evening? And I submit to you that it is nothing less than the rebirth of a voice that has been silent for at least a thousand years, the still small voice of the Logos of the planet.” “So I submit to you that what we represent is a Fifth Column, a Fifth Column that represents the best aspirations that human community is capable of, a Fifth Column that is willing to look at the structure of the psyche in contrast to the mess of society, and willing to dream.” “We have the tools, the intellect, the will to create a caring global culture. It isn’t going to come without a recognition of the power of the psychedelic experience. The psychedelic experience is the birth right of every human being on the planet. It is as much a basic part of each and every one of us as our sexuality, our national identity, our consciousness of self. And any society which attempts to hold back or impede this dimension of self-expression, when the history of that society is written, it will be called barbarous.” “In the future it will be unimaginable that governments once regulated the substances that people use to explore personal growth. It is the mark of a barbarous culture.” “One doesn’t ‘just say no’ to truth.” [NOTE: The following quotations are byAndrew Weil.] “I have to tell you that the majority of human beings that I encounter operate mostly out of fear, guilt, and that when people operate from those emotions they are dangerous to themselves and to others.” “We [the psychedelic community] are a very small minority, a very small minority, and have no illusions about that. And whether our minority will grow fast enough, and be able to influence humanity fast enough to avoid the catastrophe that is certain to come if we persist in the ways that we now persist, I don’t know?” “If it may be as it appears that our ability to manipulate the environment, our technological ability, is so disparate with our ability to control our own emotions, that may be a fatal flaw of our species. It may be.” “Deep down everything is all right, and that’s the way it’s supposed to be. And there may be a lot of drama in between [now and the extinction of our species], but it’s all all right. … It’s OK with me if something else gets a chance, if the life-force experiments with another form, that’s fine, that’s OK too.” “And here it seems to me is the fundamental absurdity of the way our science has developed: The most obvious fact of our existence is that we are conscious. That is the most obvious, most important aspect of our existence. How can you construct a world view, how can you construct a system that tries to explain the universe and leave that out? And yet that is what our science tries to do.” “Often I find, in my experience, that changes in the realm of consciousness must accompany physical treatments if the physical treatments are to work.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More Guest speaker:Terence McKenna PROGRAM NOTES: [NOTE: All quotations are byTerence McKenna… recorded in 1996, however, it is current enough to have been given just last night … maybe it was :-).] “And these angel-dealing, horoscope-casting, alchemy-pursuing visionaries of this Rosicrucian Renaissance became simply objects of historical curiosity, completely incomprehensible to the people who followed them, generation after generation after generation, until, I submit to you, the present. And in the present moment we, like they, inherit a world whose ideologies are exhausted and can only be refreshed from the margins.” “In our own time, through integrative sciences like ecology and animal behavior and psychology we have re-understood what was forgotten during the reduction centuries of modern science. We’ve re-understood that the world is one thing, and it’s a living thing. It’s a thing with an intent and a spirit within it, and this is the key concept [of alchemy].” “I think the entire message of the psychedelic experience, which is basically thesine qua nonof the rebirth of alchemical understanding, the very basis of that understanding is that nature seeks to communicate.” “Shamanism is essentially a living tradition of alchemy that is not seeking the stone but has found the stone.” “Within the context of the alchemical vocabulary, the psychedelic experience, as brought to us through plants long in the possession of Aboriginal people, appears to be the identical phenomena [as alchemy].” “All of you who have been through high dose psychedelic experiences know that it’s very hard to carry stupid baggage through that keyhole. In fact you’re lucky if you just get your soul and yourselves through and intact.” “The psychedelics have brought us back to this alchemical mystery, shorn of any vocabulary for dealing with it, shorn of any real living notion of the spirit.” “Shamanism and alchemy are a seamless enterprise.” “If you look around you, the entire global civilization is undergoing some kind of meltdown. The planet itself is now to be seen as a kind of alchemical retort. The prima materia to be transformed are the nuclear stockpiles, the toxic waste dumps, the industrial wastelands, the populations devoid of hope, the populations in threat of infectious and fatal epidemic disease. There is a great deal of prima materia to be worked on at the historical level of the alchemical process.” “In the 60’s, we thought that all that had to happen was that everybody would take LSD and the obvious right things to do would be done. And we expected no opposition to this because its rightness was so obvious. We didn’t realize that every righteous crusade in history has marched into the waiting jaws of its oppressors. But the spirit doesn’t die.” “In the 60’s then, LSD was not sufficient, even coupled with rock and roll it only brought repression [oppression?]. It was like a failed alchemy. Instead of the dissolving and recrystallizing at a higher and more angelic level thousands of prisons were built, and the entire thing failed. But this spirit is THE spirit, the spirit of life itself, the spirit of novelty itself, and it will not be suppressed for long in any time or place. So now again it comes. … It’s a spirit of dissent that says we will not serve the values of materialism, the values of the ego, and the values that separate and break down the community. So here it is again.” “We are not an army. So our strategy must be stealth. It’s an alchemical strategy, and what do I mean by stealth? I mean the house of constipated reason must be infiltrated by art, by dreamers, by vision. And what is new is that there are massive technologies available to us, not available in the 60’s. They were not designed for us. They were not intended for us. It was never ever thought that such power should flow into the hands of freaks such as ourselves. Never-the-less, through the perverse nature of the unfolding of the world, we have such tools. And I’m referring, as you probably anticipate, to the World Wide Web and the Internet.” “Well now you can find the others, you don’t have to stick a flower in your hair and go to San Francisco. You just go to the Web. Find the others. We all need to create affinity groups which are subsets of the much larger community that we’re part of. And then, using this technology, which was designed to keep track of us, to pick our pockets, and to sell us junk we don’t want, use this technology to produce art, massive amounts of subversive art, and ALL art is subversive, I’m not calling for an ideological agenda. All truth that springs from the individual is subversive, because culture is not your friend.” “My brother, years ago, invented this term. He called it extra-environmental. He said, ‘This is what we want to be. We don’t want to be Americans, or Germans, or English. We want to be extra-environmentalists. Always feel wherever you go that you are a stranger, the outsider, the one looking in. This is the viewpoint that makes all places the same to you.’ “ “I think transcending our cultures is going to be extraordinarily necessary for our survival. I don’t think we can carry our cultures through the keyhole of the stretch of the next millennium” “This is what you are, you are some kind of a mystery suspended between two eternities. And in that moment, when a mind looks out at a world and asks the question, ‘What is it?’ In that moment art can be created. And it is the only form of immortality that I have any certainty of, and it’s available to everyone.” “A great turning point is in the offing. The world is changing. It’s changed before, but not for a long time in our lives, not since before our lives. But now it’s changing, and there are many many possibilities.” “Launch your meme boldly and see if it will replicate.” “Part of what is wrong with our society, and hence with ourselves, is that we consume images, we don’t produce them. We need to produce, not consume, media.” “Inevitably out of the psychedelic experience emerges not despair, not self-indulgence, but wild-eyed idealism, that’s the inevitable product of any psychedelically driven social process.” “If you take psychedelics and the Internet and music and put all of that together you have the basis for a new community that is wider and deeper than you know. The people who are building the new machines, who are designing the new circuitry, who are writing the new code are ALL freaks. They work for capitalist dogs, of course, because we all do, but the creative thrust of these technologies is being driven by people just like you and me.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

Who cares about the good and evil in the evolution of species, and so on? This must be interesting only to the degree to which it informs us in this very present moment regarding our choices that we will make in the creation of our future.”-Ralph Abraham “In a dynamical system, or a massively complex dynamical system such as we live in, when there is a moment of bifurcation, which is the technical mass jargon for “the snap”, that is the only time you get to do anything about the evolution of the system. So according to this self-inflating view, we live at an especially important special moment in history where when we think something or do something it has actually an enormous effect on the future. … What we do has some influence on the creation of the future more than at other times in history.”-Ralph Abraham “The edge of the millennium, any edge of any of the millennia, is particularly important to those revolutionary souls who want to make a change in things. It is a special time.”-Ralph Abraham “Salvation is an act of cognitive apprehension.”-Terence McKenna “This is a moment of enormous opportunity, and those who find themselves in this moment with power, defined however you care to define it, have a moral obligation to act. … What we must become is clear.”-Terence McKenna “To the degree that we can change our minds we will escape extinction.”-Terence McKenna “If you charge off with some political agenda that is not informed by clarity you’re going to end up with business as usual. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, but it is not paved with clarity.”-Terence McKenna “I certainly agree that for me personally, psychedelic experience has enhanced clarity, whereas some people think the opposite.”-Ralph Abraham “I think that grass root research, based on phenomena that are actually common sense, that are part of everyday life for many people, could help to wake us up, to give a greater clarity about what’s really going on, and make us recognize that there’s far more interconnection between us and other species, and us and other people, than is admitted in the scientific view of things, which is the world view which most people feel they have permission to talk about in public.”-Rupert Sheldrake “What we’re saying is that we must dissolve the artificial boundaries that confine our perceptions. Someone once said, ‘If we could feel what we are doing to the Earth we would stop immediately.’ . . . So we have compartmentalized our lives, and this allows us to do the fateful and lethal work that is destroying the planet, destroying communities, and so forth.”-Terence McKenna “Culture is a scheme for maintaining and creating boundaries. It replaces reality with a linguistically supported delusion.”-Terence McKenna “As long as we believe in mind and matter, rich and poor, living and dead, aboriginal and advanced, black and white, man and woman, then we’re inevitably going to carry on a dualistic analysis of our dilemma, and we’re going to produce incomplete agendas and answers.”-Terence McKenna “The great evil that has been allowed to flourish in the absence of mathematical understanding is relativism. And what is relativism? It’s the idea that there is no distinction between shit and Shinola. That all ideas are somehow operating on equal footing.”-Terence McKenna “The enemy that will really subvert the enterprise of building a world based on clarity is the belief that we cannot point out the pernicious forms of idiocy that flourish in our own community.”-Terence McKenna “Yes, well it is an ambitious enterprise, and fraught with contradiction, but forward, ever forward!”-Terence McKenna DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

And this is what we created that is uniquely human and that has defined us ever since.”-Terence McKenna “You don’t need to go straight beyond the universe to the divine mind, there’s plenty of lower-level minds than the divine mind that could be out there.”-Rupert Sheldrake “My notion of the mystical is simply that which remains to be understood, and there will always be a residuum of mystery in principle, but in principle it is not mysterious.”-Terence McKenna[Rupert disagreed with this.] “The idea that this evolution’s equipped us with minds, and language, and cognitive abilities that enable us to comprehend the entire universe, where it’s come from, where it’s going, what minds and mind may lie beyond what we see, the idea that this very small part of the evolutionary system, with all the limitations inherent in it, could comprehend the whole seems to me a rather improbable supposition.”-Rupert Sheldrake “It’s not decided what’s going to happen next, there are imaginations of many levels, including human imaginations, at work here, looking at alternative possibilities. New things happen, and then what happens next depends on what’s happened already and the new possibilities of imagination that open up, but without the goal being fixed in advance.”-Rupert Sheldrake “[Evolution] is a game, one of the rules of which is: The rules can change.”-Terence McKenna “Time is not a tyranny. It’s a relativistic medium subject to all kinds of plasticity. There are many ways out of any assumed corner we paint ourselves into.”-Terence McKenna DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

They allow things to be more obvious, more apparent than the conscious mind usually lets them be.” “The psychedelics, the visionary plants, allow you to do deeper looking and a different kind of learning, because what comes to you is a different sort of knowledge.” “The ’shadow work’ is, perhaps, the most important use of these materials, as far as I’m concerned, that there is. Because it’s in opening up the shadow and discovering it’s not a monster, that it’s not a terrible, horrible beast, that it is the uncultivated, the unsophisticated and slightly, sometimes, unlawful part of ourselves, which can be one of our greatest allies as long as we can find the courage to do the work necessary to discover it and become one with it and to negotiate with it.” “I consider them [psychedelics] basically spiritual tools.” BABA RAM DAS:“The place we share is that place that stands nowhere, not the place that’s caught in these spirals that involve intellectual advance, or ‘Now we know it!’, and so on. That’s all like little ripples on the ocean.” “The Great Way is not difficult for those who have no preferences. When love and hate are absent, everything becomes clear and undisguised.” TIMOTHY LEARY:“…neuro-geography that tells us that where you are determines who you are, habitat determines species.” “We are literally at a position where collectively, working in harmony, we can do most of the things, and take the responsibilities, which in the past have been attributed to the great deities of the past. I think the Golden Age is ahead. It’s the age of humanist science, humanist technology, pagan science, pagan technology, high tech, high touch.” “I think it’s our duty as explorers and as frontier scouts for our species to invent new terminology. … I really feel that words are tremendously important. . . . We’ve got to develop a new terminology. We simply can’t use the language that has been around for three or four thousand years because more people have been killed in the name of god that any other word around.” TERENCE MCKENNA:“Well somebody once asked me, you know, “Is it dangerous?” And the answer is, only if you fear death by astonishment.” “Do not give way to astonishment! Do not abandon yourself to wonder! Get a grip! Try to get a grip, and notice what we’re doing! Pay attention!” – this is the mantra: “Pay attention! Pay attention!” “On DMT, these entities – these machine-like, diminutive, shape-shifting, faceted machine elf type creatures that come bounding out of the state – they come bounding out of my stereo speakers, if I have my eyes open – they are like, you know, they are elfin embodiments of syntactical intent. Somehow syntax, which is normally the invisible architecture behind language, has moved into the foreground. And you can see it! I mean, it’s doing calisthenics and acrobatics in front of you! It’s crawling all over you! And what’s happened is that your categories have been scrambled, or something; and this thing which is normally supposed to be invisible and in the background and an abstraction has come forward and is doing handsprings right in front of you. And the thing makes linguistic objects; it sheds syntactical objectification. So that it comes towards you – they come toward you – they divide, they merge, they’re bounding, they’re screaming, they’re squeaking – and they hold out objects, which they sing into existence, or which they pull out of some other place. And these things are, you know, like jewels and lights, but also like consommé and old farts and yesterday and high speed; in other words, they are made of juxtapositions of qualities that are impossible in three-dimensional space. What they’re like is – and in fact, this is probably what they are – what they’re like is, they’re like three- and four- and five-dimensional puns. And you know how the pleasure of a pun lies in the fact that it is… it’s not that the meaning flickers from A to B; it’s that it’s simultaneously A and B, and when the pun is really funny it’s an A,B,C,D pun; and it’s simultaneously all these things… well, that quality, which in our experience can only occur to an acoustical output or a glyph which stands for an acoustical output – in other words, a printed pun – in the DMT world, objects can do this. Objects can simultaneously manifest more than one nature at once. And, like a pun, the result is always funny. It’s amusing! You cannot help but be delighted by this thing doing this thing.” “History is a con game run by frightened men and their obedient stooges.” “The transformation of culture through art is the proper understanding of what you can do with psychedelics besides blow your own mind.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option AlexWallMusic.comTerence McKenna AudioSasha Shulgin Audio"

It’s the currency by which fools navigate the world. Smart people get beyond it.”“If you aren’t ‘cool’ then you go to incredible lengths to achieve it by ersatz means, by buying $3,500 sunglasses and getting tattooed. But it can’t really be faked. But the whole engine of marketing is designed to make you think that it can be faked. I don’t know if I’m cool or not, but I am incredibly resistant to any effort to make me think I’m uncool.” “You don’t want to become so open-minded that the wind can whistle between your ears.” “It’s very important to hone intuition and logical razors so that reasonable questions can be asked. … This nobody ever criticizing anybody else brings the intellectual enterprise and the refinement of human knowledge to a screeching halt. The way in which the intellectual enterprise moves forward is by being critiqued, analyzed, subjected to tests.” “Scientists really respect each other for proving that they are wrong. If you have a theory that you’ve defended for fifteen years, and then you publish a paper saying, ‘I’ve been over it again. I’ve looked at the data again, and you know what fellow colleagues, I botched it. I was wrong.’ They promote you for this. They say, ‘This is the essence of intellectual honesty.’ … Religion doesn’t work like this. In the religious domain you never admit you’re wrong. You further elaborate the story to save whatever preposterous notion has been exposed. … And so what you get is error based on error based on delusion based on illusion based on lie based on half-truth based on supposition based on somebody thought it would be nice IF.” “Somewhere after the Sixties, when the government decided that universal public education only created mobs milling in the streets calling for human rights, education ceased to serve the goal of producing an informed citizenry. And instead we took an authoritarian model. The purpose of education [today in the United States] is to produce unquestioning consumers with an alcoholic obsession for work. And so it is.” “If you turn cannabis into a Schedule I drug, a felony, suddenly all of these people who never felt inspired to dissent, never felt the heavy hand of the government, are automatically members of a criminal class. And what this does is thus radicalize the people so persecuted, and in a feedback loop of paranoia drive the government then into a frenzy of trying to understand and control this minority group. The idea that states of mind are matters for legal manipulation, it’s amazing that that discussion is even taking place in a democracy founded by Thomas Jefferson.” “In the whole Marxist episode nobody was ever required to piss in a cup in the Soviet Union or Mao’s China to establish their loyalty to the government or the corporations, and yet that went down here with barely a murmur.” “Once you find psychedelics there’s nothing between you and a complete check-out from your cultural heritage. The only cost to you is the complete abandonment of everything you’ve ever known and loved.” “You can choose to be free, but it’s the last choice you’ll ever make.” –Kafka [McKenna’s Five Percent Rule] “As long as any school of dissent remains below five percent of the population no money is budgeted to destroy it.” “I think that no one is in charge, and this is a very good thing because it allows the internal dynamic of the situation to express itself. Everybody who wants to control the situation is fighting a loosing battle.” “I don’t feel this need for intellectual closure. I don’t see why things should make sense.” [McKenna’s Law] “As you advance in social hierarchy the percentage of smart people does not increase. … Every human situation is bedeviled by morons. No matter how high you rise you’re surrounded by fools, and you’re lucky if you’re not one of them. That’s the basic thing to guard against.” “It’s pretty simple, the ethical life. It’s just demanding.” “The mushroom said to me once, for one human being to seek enlightenment from another is like a grain of sand on the beach seeking enlightenment from another.” “Culture is institutionalized paranoia.” “I think what’s happened is that the top of the culture, it’s profoundly intellectually bankrupt. There is no plan except to keep peddling stuff, basically until the forests are gone and the oceans polluted. It’s not malevolent. It’s simply that they are clueless.” “What I’m pleading for is an enlightened form of alienation, not simply an emotionally driven alienation, but a strategically driven alienation. See, alienation can be used not to create neurosis but to attain freedom, creative alienation, alienation that embraces itself as the source of inspiration.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

Why is it that fully 80% of the world’s known plant hallucinogens are concentrated in the Amazon basin, even though the flora of the Old World jungles of Indonesia is equally rich?” “The curing scenario of the ayahuascero is easily identified to the curing scenario of shamans world wide.” “I think the word ‘psychedelic’ is maybe too broad, because it includes things which are very different from each other. It can include things as different as ketamine and mescaline.” “The icaros, the magical songs, are actually technical tools for controlling the fabric of the hallucination.” “It seems very clear that this [ayahuasca] healthcare delivery system is very effective, perhaps more effective than our own, especially in the treating of psychological disorders.” “You must be aware that I have other wrinkles, the extraterrestrial angle, the end of history angle, several different things, but all of these things were inspired by our belief that these Amazon peoples have a technology for exploring the modalities of the unconscious that is centuries ahead of us.” “But what I have become convinced of from using these hallucinogenic drugs is that the major portion of the unconscious has very little to do with human beings. It is simply a modality, an interior landscape, and large portions of it are not human.” “As techniques are developed for exploring consciousness, these trans-human, non-human dimensions slowly come into view. It appears to be a co-equal dimension of existential validity, which our cultural and linguistic programming has blinded us to rather severely.” “[The mushroom] is not a drug of acceptance, you know. It want’s transformation of a very radical sort. The ayahuasca seems to integrate.” “Ayahuasca is wonderfully suggestive and can be led in a way that these other things sometimes can’t be.” “What does it mean that on a psychedelic drug one person can see more art in an hour than the species has produced in 10,000 years? What does that say about how effectively we are accessing our souls?” “If you want a miracle, then language is the thing to look at.” “I think literature occupies the same relationship to life that life that life occupies to death.” “I imagine death to be a kind of release into the imagination.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

The way you understand and investigate time is by moving inward, into metabolism. The human body is a knot in time.” “I live in a kind of waking hallucination. I have a little aphorism which covers this. It’s: Rome falls nine times an hour. It falls more than that and less than that, but let’s say it falls nine times an hour. Well, then your job is to notice every time it falls. In other words, what we think of as our random musings and our personal mental furniture is in fact our subconscious awareness of these systems of temporal resonance operating around us.” [Comment by Lorenzo: I have no idea what he means by this.] “I do entertain the idea that we may each have our own Timewave, sort of following the model of astrology.” “What will happen, as novelty asymptotically increases, in the final months, hours, minutes, seconds is boundaries will dissolve, all boundaries They’re already dissolving. We see the nation-state dissolving, but wait’ll the atomic field dissolves.” “It’s not a gravity collapse. It’s a novelty collapse. We are collapsing into a black hole of novelty.” “The future is not like the past except that it hasn’t happened. If you were to suddenly find yourself in the future, it’s a vector-storm of unrealized possibilities. You’ve never seen an unrealized possibility.” “I believe that the idea that is the most fun is probably the closest to the truth, and I find this idea to be absolutely delightful.” “The whole thing [Timewave hypothesis] smacks of the impossible. It’s even pushed me toward the idea that maybe this is not actually a reality. We’re trapped, or I’m trapped. I don’t know if you’re trapped. But we’re in some kind of piece of fiction. It’s like a Phillip K. Dick deal, you know. We’re in some kind of simulacrum, and the clue to the fact that it’s a simulacrum is this impossible idea [the Timewave]. And so the point of the idea is not to believe it, but to use it as a wedge to fight our way out of this labyrinth and back to whatever reality we were in before we fell into this situation.

It raises the possibility then that the imagination is in fact a kind of organ of perception, not an organ of creative unfoldment, but actually an organ of perception.

And so we are on the brink of a time, we have arrived, we are at the time where the human imagination now need meet no barriers to its intent. And so we are going to find out who we are. We are going to discover what it means to be human when there is no resistance to human will.” “Shamanism didn’t use matter to build its realities. It was more sophisticated than that.

What those people are describing is far more mundane than a DMT trip.” “I would suggest, with great heat, that if we want to study the near-death and after-death experience, that actually you come far closer to dying, whatever that means, on DMT than you do in drownings and things like that.” “If you’re living right, your life should get just more and more baroque, beautiful, complicated, mysterious … and then you die.” “I prefer to think that it [2012] is not a planetary catastrophe, or a mass dying.” “Perhaps what enlightenment is is it happens to an entire universe when it drops its matter and anti-matter out of its structure, and it becomes entirely made of light.

If nothing lasts, then there’s a conclusion, not a feeling to be drawn from that observation, the conclusion to be drawn from it is then the felt present of the immediate moment must be what life is for.” “I would say the bouquet of life is this moment.” “I certainly am not interested in living forever, whatever that might mean, because I suspect if you live forever you miss the point.” “We’ve invented a sin for which there is no name. It’s so beyond most people’s ability to conceive. And this sin that we’ve invented is we steal the future from our children.” “Life is what you get when a hyper dimensional object protrudes into ordinary space.” “We clothe ourselves in matter, but we are not matter.” “In my highest states I have had the insight, which I will convey to you without saying it’s true, that this [human existence] is the most limited form of existence you will ever know. You can’t be deader than this. This is the bottom line, and so the good news is it’s only up from here.” “The last dance you dance alone, and nobody will be watching.” “I don’t think you should live in anticipation of the drama of your death-bead scene, better to repair to the moment.” “The real message of the psychedelic experience and of the anti-historical thrust of the critique we’ve been carrying out here is to take the moment. The felt presence of immediate experience, this is all you know. It’s all you will ever know. Everything else comes as unconfirmed rumor, innuendo, unrealized possibilities, fading memory, conjecture, lie, hope, who knows? But in the moment of being we have the completion of being. It is always complete, every moment.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More Guest speaker:Terence McKenna PROGRAM NOTES: This is the Question and Answer session following the talk heard in the previous podcast. In it, Terence answers questions from the audience, such as, “Can you talk about the relationship of advanced mathematics to modeling of consciousness in layman’s terms?” [NOTE: All quotations below are byTerence McKenna.] “It doesn’t matter whether it’s the birth and death of your hope, or the rise and fall of the Assyrian Empire, or the evolution of the Pacific Ocean, processes always occur in the same way. And this is why there is congruence between the mental world of human beings and the world of abstract mathematics and the world of nature. These things are as it were simply different levels of condensation of the same universal stuff.” “Thinking means something. It’s not just something we do. It means something. It means something because there is sufficient freedom within the human system to be both right or wrong.” QUESTION:What is the nature of magic, or what is magic or the wonder it invokes? “Magic is not a trivial issue at all.” “If you live long enough, I think you discover what we imagine and what actually is are very close to the same thing.” “The mind is somehow a co-creator in the process of reality, through acts of language. And language is very, very mysterious. I mean, it is true magic.” “All so-called primitive people know that the world is made up of language. That you sing it into existence. That what you say it is is what it is. That is it maintained in existence by an act of rational apprehension.” “Mind is necessary for the world to undergo the formality of existing. This is what quantum physics teaches.” “Modern biology is still afflicted with physics envy. Meanwhile, physics has gone on to a realm of such exotic and surreal uncertainty that it’s, at this point, to the left of psychology in the precision of its metaphors.” QUESTION:Why don’t some people get high when they take psychedelics? “The way to do psychedelics is, I believe, at higher doses than most people are comfortable with and rarely, and with great attention to set and setting.” “But these boundary-dissolving hallucinogens that give you a sense of unity with your fellow man and nature are somehow forbidden. This is an outrage. It’s a sign of cultural immaturity, and the fact that we tolerate it is a sign that we are living in a society as oppressed as any society in the past.” “We are caged by our cultural programing, and this is the most powerful imprisoning factor in our lives.” “If we could train ourselves to simply remember our dreams, psychedelics would become obsolete.” “Culture is a mass hallucination, and when you step outside the mass hallucination you see it for what it is worth.” “Language is partially the key here. We cannot move into a reality we cannot describe. If we can’t describe a world, we can’t be there.” “As long as we let the establishment set the language agenda we will be imprisoned in the tiny, rather pedestrian, world of consumerism and schloko values that the establishment has prepared for us.” “The way I think of these psychedelics are a different way, is that they are catalysts for the imagination.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

[NOTE: The following quotations are byTerence McKenna.] “What’s the hang-up here? What is the problem? Why is perfection so distant?” “Alchemy, as I’m sure many of you know, is really the secret tradition of the redemption of spirit from matter. … The central conception of alchemy is the conception of the philosopher’s stone. What is it? It’s the universal panacea at the end of time. It’s the chocolate cake that your mother made once a week when you were a child. … It’s all things to all men and all women. … It is not a myth or a fairy tale. It is the burning, primary reality, that lies behind the dross of appearances.” “We have no idea what it would mean in our own lives if we could throw off the notion of ourselves as fallen beings. We are not fallen beings” “[We] often feel like hapless atoms, running endlessly according to the blueprints and programs of unseen masters, whether it’s the banking industry, Madison Avenue, whoever. We tend to disempower ourselves. We tend to believe that we don’t matter. And in the act of taking that idea to ourselves we give everything away to somebody else, to something else.” “There is no inevitability in our lives unless we submit to the idea of inevitability and then give ourselves over to it.” “Every society, in the moment of its existence, has lived as a resonance, a completion, and a distillation (good alchemical word), a distillation of what has preceded before.” “Dark as the hour may appear, in reality we exist in a dimension of greater opportunity, greater freedom, greater possibility than has ever been. The challenge then is to not drop the ball.” “What psychedelic means is getting your mind out in front of you, by whatever means necessary, so that you can relate to it as a thing in the world and then work upon it.” “The mushroom said to me once, ‘Nature loves courage. Nature loves courage,’ and I said, ‘What’s the payoff on that?’ And it said, ‘It shows you it loves courage because it removes obstacles.’ You make a commitment, and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream, and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up.” “It is never one or the other. It does a tremendous injustice to being to ignore the union of opposites.” “It’s absolutely irrational to not be filled with the fire of consuming hope. You just have to overcome the leveling that we inherit from these empty, existential, scientific ideas.” “We are the last people. Beyond us lies the mystery if we have but the courage to move forward into that abyss, to believe that nature will reward the dreamer. Then we can complete that wonderful Irish toast that says, ‘May ye be alive at the end of the world.’ “ DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option Leo Plaw at the Temple of Visions Gallery(Los Angeles) Fantastic Visions Exhbition Berlin the sun blindness"

Then we stand back and look at our lives and our societies and say how come they have no meaning? It’s because we labored like demons to make sure that they didn’t have meaning, and now we have no one to blame but ourselves for the gross simplification of reality and the betrayal of experience that we achieved in that process.” “Feelings are primary. The primary datum of experience is feeling, and then out of that comes a logical reframing of experience. And then still lower on the rung, and I maintain lower on the rung that one shouldn’t go that low, is an ideological recasting of experience.” “I think it’s really important to keep things as simple as possible because they will still be hellaciously complex if you are true to experience. The simplest explanation of what is going on here is still maddeningly baroque. So throwing on flying saucers and papal plotting and the plans of Great Atlantis only further exacerbates the problem.” “We know that behind all this constipated sociability lies the chaos of the psychedelic experience. It’s important to keep it in mind in very psychedelically situations. But people who have never broken through the cultural dream take it to be reality and commit crimes based on delusion about what is and isn’t reality.” “The ego is a maladaptive, tumor-like growth in the personality that has been inculcated into you by the toxicity of the culture. It is literally the response to toxic cultures. The more toxic the culture the more ego is revered as a natural value within that culture.” “People are clueless, and they’re being used and abused. Seemingly intelligent people behave in incredibly stupid ways. The phenomenon of the respectability of aimless shopping. Shopping is unconsciousable. It’s stupid. It’s tasteless. It’s murderous towards the Earth. … Somehow the message has to be put across that there are no exceptions to the obligation to decomodify experience. … What is the charm of all this crap? Can anybody explain it to me?” “Novelty is that quality of nature that seeks complexity. It’s countervailing force is called habit.” “The Timewave is not occult, but it is not science as we have done it these past 500 years, because it assumes that one of our primary intuitions is actually true; the intuition that every moment is unique [time is not uniform]. It treats that as the central starting point for an entirely new metaphysics of being.” “The way you investigate time is by moving inward, by investigating metabolism.

In a sense, I sort of share that notion. It’s a very Talmudic notion. It’s a very psychedelic notion. It’s the idea that somehow the career of the word is the central, overarching metaphor of the age. And, naturally, if the book is the central metaphor for reality, then reality itself is seen as somehow literary, somehow textual. And this is in fact how I think reality was seen until the rise of modern science.” “The idea of the individual is a post-Medieval concept legitimized by print. The idea of the public, this concept did not exist before newspapers.” “The notion of an observing citizenry somehow sharing the governance of society, this again is a print-created idea.” “Reading is not looking. Reading is an entirely different kind of behavior. … Nobody opens a book and looks at print … We read print, but we look at manuscript, because manuscript carries the intrinsic signification of the individual who made it.” “[Quoting Marshall McLuhan] High definition is the state of being well-filled with data.” “Print is the least invisible of all media. Print is an incredible Rube Goldberg invention for conveying information.”We are going beyond the entire domain of scribal humanity and actually reaching back to a shamanic feeling-tone kind of thing.” “A perfect media is an invisible media, and print is the least invisible of all media.” “Those who read, do not see, even when they lift their eyes from their books, they carry the attitude of print into the world. They read. They attempt to read nature. And you can’t read nature. You must look at nature. You must see nature.” ” ‘The Medium is the message’ means that the medium is the thing which is making the difference.” “Imagine if a drug had been introduced in 1948 that we all spent six and one-half hours per day, on average, watching. And the one thing about drugs, in their defense, is that it’s very hard to diddle the message. A drug is a mirror, but television isn’t a mirror. Television is a billboard, and anybody who pays their money can put their message into the trip.

There is no character, per se. You never know who is speaking.” ” ‘Finnegan’s Wake’ is as if you had taken the entirety of the last thousand years of human history and dissolved all the boundaries.” “Joyce, once in a famous interview, said that if the whole universe were to be destroyed, and only ‘Finnegan’s Wake’ survive, that the goal had been that then the entire universe could be reconstructed out of this.” “It’s about as close to LSD on the page as you can get.” “Anna Livia Plurabelle is Molly Bloom on acid, basically.” “People say the psychedelic experience is hard to remember, dreams are hard to remember, but harder to remember than either of those is simply ordinary experience.” “The character of life is like a work of literature. We are told that you are supposed to fit your experience into the model which science gives you, which is probabilistic, statistical, predictable, and yet the felt datum of experience is much more literary than that.” “What all these people are saying, I think, and what the psychedelic experience argues for as well, is that we are somehow prisoners of language.” “We are living in a terminal civilization. I don’t want to say dying, because civilizations aren’t animals. But we are living in an age of great self-summation. … Western civilization has had a thousand years to work its magic, and now there is a summation underway.” “The purpose of literature, I think, is to illuminate the past and to give a certain guidance as we move into the future.” “Somehow, complexity is the ocean we have to learn to surf.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option  The Oracle Gatherings … June 2009 … The Fountain"

More specifically, is there any permission for smart people to hope? I mean it’s easy to hope if you’re stupid, but is there any basis for intelligent people to hope? … I think so.”“I live in an aura of hope because I live in a twilight world of my own self-generated, cannabinated fantasy, and I forget that not everyone is so fortunate.” “What I’ve observed is that nature builds on previously established levels of complexity.” “An added wrinkle [to the story of ever-increasing complexity] is that each advancement into complexity, into novelty, proceeds more quickly than the stage that preceded it. This is very profound.” “I say, if in fact novelty is the name of the game. If in fact the conservation and complexification of novelty is what the universe is striving for, then suddenly our own human enterprise, previously marginalized, takes on an immense new importance. We are apparently players in the cosmic drama. And in this particular act of the cosmic drama we hold a very central role. We are at the pinnacle of the expression of the complexification in the animal world.” “Since the rise of Western monotheism, the human experience has been marginalized. We have been told that we were unimportant in the cosmic drama. But we now know from the feedback that we’re getting from the impact of human culture on the Earth that we are a major factor shaping the temperatures of the oceans, the composition of the atmosphere …” “History is a state of incredible destabilization. It’s a chaostrophy in the process of happening.” “It’s very important to science to eliminate from its thinking any suspicion that this eschaton might exist. Because if it were to exist it would impart to reality a purpose. … Science is incredibly hostile toward the idea of purpose.” “Reality is accelerating toward an unimaginable Omega point.” “So why hope? Isn’t it just a runaway train out of control? I don’t think so. I think the out-of-control-ness is the most hopeful thing about it. After all, whose control is it out of? You and I never controlled it in the first place. Why are we anxious about the fact that it’s out of control. I think that if it’s out of control then our side is winning.” “We represent a kind of concrescence of universal intent. We’re not mere spectators, or a cosmic accident, or some sideshow, or the Greek chorus to the main event. The human experience IS the main event.” “In our species complexity has turned inward upon itself. And in our species time has accelerated. Time has left the gentle ebb and flow of gene transfer and adaptation that characterizes biological evolution, and instead historical time is generated.” “It is impossible to conceive of another thousand years of human history. History then is ending. History is a kind of gestation process. It’s a kind of metamorphosis. It’s an episode in the life of a species.” “Culture is merely clothing on the human experience.” “The body is the nexus of the mystery of life, and our culture takes us out of the body.” “More and more, the message that people are getting as they avail themselves of the psychedelic experience is that it is not a journey into the human unconscious, or into the ghost bardos of our chaotic civilization. It’s a journey into the presence of the Gaian Mind.” “We now hold, through the possession of these psychedelics, catalysts for the human imagination of sufficient power that if we use them we can deconstruct the lethal vehicle that is carrying us toward the brink of Apocalypse We can deconstruct that vehicle and redesign it into a kind of starship that would carry us and our children out into the broad starry galaxy we know to be awaiting us.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

And it remains mysterious.” “The psychedelic experience is the beginning of the spiritual path.

Psychedelic people are holding it back with all their power, because they are IN the presence of the Mystery. And then the trick is to get a spigot on it so that it can be turned on and off rather than coming at you like a tidal wave a mile high and twenty miles wide.” “What the churches are peddling is high abstraction, and you really have to work yourself up into a lather to be able to accept that as worthy of that kind of attention.

You will see what your relationship to it is.” “This is a general comment that you should take a committed dose of whatever it is you’re taking so that there is no ambiguity, because there’s nothing worse than a sub-threshold psychedelic experience.” “On ketemine you can get so out there that it is a major intellectual breakthrough to realize that you’re on a drug.” “At the interface of the sayable and the unsayable [in a psychedelic experience] is the novel, the new, the never before seen, said or done.

I want to be taken seriously as proposing that the ennui of modernity is the consequence of a disruptive symbiotic relationship between ourselves and vegetable nature.” “… of what is essentially a pathological personality pattern. The pattern of the omniscient, omnipresent, all-knowing, wrathful male deity, no one you would invite to your garden party.” “Technique [in taking entheogens] to me is a kind of a … I’m reluctant to talk about it because it seems so obvious to me what good technique is. I mean, you sit down, you shut up, and you pay attention is basically the good technique. And then the footnotes add; on an empty stomach, in a dark room, feeling comfortable.” “The situation that we now reside in is not one of seeking the answer, but facing the answer.” “I mean, we’re playing with half a deck as long as we tolerate that the Cardinals of government and science should dictate where human curiosity can legitimately send its attention and where it cannot. It’s essentially a preposterous situation. It is essentially a civil rights issue because what we’re talking about here is the repression of a religious sensibility In fact, not a religious sensibility, THE religious sensibility.” “Life lived in the absence of the psychedelic experience that primordial shamanism is based on is life trivialized, life denied, life enslaved to the ego.” “Think about our dilemma on this planet. If the expansion of consciousness does not loom large in the human future, what kind of future is it going to be?” “The ‘public’ has no history, has no future, lives in a golden moment created by credit, which binds them ineluctably to a fascist system that is never criticized. This is the ultimate consequence of having broken off this symbiotic relationship with the vegetable, feminine, maternal matrix of the planet.” “How can we know who is the other until we know who is the self?” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option Tibet2Timbuk2The song, “Beautiful Girl”,played at the end of this podcast,is from their album titled Music is Life.

There will not, apparently, be business as usual.” “You either have a plan, or you are a part of somebody else’s plan.” “The psychedelic sets you at the beginning of the path, and then people do all kinds of things with it.” “We are reaping the fruits of ten thousand, fifty thousand years of sowing of the fields of mind. And it is being dropped into our laps for us to create human-machine interfacing, control of genetic material, redefinition of social reality, re engineering of languages, revisioning of the planetary ecology, all these things fall upon us.” “I’m fascinated by hallucinations. I mean, to me that is the sina qua non that you’re getting somewhere.” “If you actually look at the etymology of the word ‘hallucination’, what it’s come to mean in English is a delusion. But what it really means in the original language is to wander in the mind. That’s the meaning of ‘hallucination’, to wander in the mind.” “For unknown reasons, there is a tremendous concentration of psychoactive plants on the South American continent. The South American continent has more known hallucinogens than the rest of the planet combined.” “Patanjali specifically says that there are three paths to the goal of yoga.

From nature being bound into a rigid, deterministic model, freedom, spontaneity and openness are emerging once again. It’s now recognized the future is open, not determined by the past. And this is true in many realms, the astronomical realm, the human realm, the meteorological realm in many ways.”–Rupert Sheldrake “The basic idea I’m proposing is that the so-called ‘Laws of Nature’ may be more like habits. They may depend on what’s happened before and on how often it’s happened. So there may be a cumulative memory in nature, largely unconscious, which gives rise to habits and things, which accounts for the stability of nature as we know it. But this is not all governed by eternal laws that were there at the Big Bang.”–Rupert Sheldrake “The English couldn’t bear this void for long, caused by the suppression of pilgrimage [by the Protestant Reformation], and within a few generations had invented tourism, which is best seen as a form of secularized pilgrimage.”–Rupert Sheldrake “I think a great move forward would happen when astronomy and astrology link up once again.”–Rupert Sheldrake “If the Sun has a kind of consciousness, then what about the entire galaxy, with this mysterious center?”–Rupert Sheldrake “What we call the imagination is actually the universal library of what is real, that you couldn’t imagine it if it weren’t real, somewhere, sometime. And that to me is very empowering because that’s the truth that you learn at the center of the psychedelic experience that’s so mind boggling that you can’t really return with it, that it’s real.”–Terence McKenna “Now it’s time to realize that trying to reason upward from the laws of atomic physics to organism is not going to work.

I would hide for just a few cycles while I figured out what it was all about and just exactly where I wanted to push and where I wanted to pull.” “All time is is how much change you can pack into a second.” “You can stand back and look at this planet and see that we have the money, the power, the medical understanding, the scientific know-how, the love, and the community to produce a kind of human paradise.” “It [culture] invites people to diminish themselves, and dehumanize themselves by behaving like machines, meme processors of memes passed down from Madison Avenue, and Hollywood, and what have you.” “Man was not put on this planet to toil in the mud. Or the god who put us on this planet to toil in the mud is no god I want to have any part of. It’s some kind of gnostic demon. It’s some kind of cannibalistic demiurge that should be thoroughly renounced and rejected.” “It was the fall into history that enslaved us to the labor cycle, to the agricultural cycle. And notice how fiendish it is.” “This is a society, a world, a planet dying because there is not enough consciousness, because there is not enough awareness, enough coordination of intent-to-problem. And yet, we spend vast amounts of money stigmatizing people and substances that are part of this effort to expand consciousness, see things in different ways, unleash creativity. Isn’t it perfectly clear that business as usual is a bullet through the head?” “To me it begins and ends with these psychedelic substances. The synergy of the psilocybin in the hominid diet brought us out of the animal mind and into the world of articulated speech and imagination.” “Having lived long enough to go at least once or twice around the block, I’m noticing that the strangeness is not receding The strangeness seems to be accelerating.” “I started out in psychedelic drugs, and people said it was a flight from reality. It still is a flight from reality, but I think reality is now a bit more scary than the drugs we used to fly from it, so long ago.” “It’s getting funnier because everybody’s categories are disintegrating, and the cult of political correctness dictates that we never point out that other people don’t make sense.” “Beauty is self-defined, perceived and understood without ambiguity, and beauty is the stuff that lies under the skins of our individual existences.” “The momentum now is inevitable. Now it’s about each of us individually arranging the furniture of our own mind to deal with what has become inevitable.” “What is happening here is we are living past the age, by the millions, living past the age where cultural values make any sense at all.” “When your time is turned into money, the felt presence of immediate experience is analogous to being enslaved.

Alien, but full of promise, it throws open a potential for understanding that will sweep away the petty concerns of earth and history-bound humanity.” “Reason, but a willingness to explore the edges has been [my] method. … I have never seen a violation of physics that was not connected somehow with a psychedelic experience.” “Not all psychedelics are alike. And this very small family of compounds, called the tryptomine hallucinogens, bear careful examination if we’re seriously interested in this question of exterrestial penetration of the human world.” “Everybody knows this who has to do with this stuff [psilocybin], Gordon Wasson, Richard Shulties, Albert Hofmann, the giants know that this stuff is animate. This is not a drug. It’s something that’s disguising itself as a drug in order not to spread alarm.” “I think that the alien will be so alien that your jaw will hang in the air. And expecting to meet an anthropoid-like alien with an interest in your reproductive machinery and gross industrial capacity is as culture-bound a concept as searching NGC-321 for a good Italian restaurant. It’s absurd on the face of it.” “All of human history is the signifier of the presence of the alien. Human history is what happens to an advance animal species when it is inner-penetrated on a scale of a million years by a mind in another dimension.” “The flying saucer, the alien, the other is what is sculpting us out of animal organization as we move toward it in time. This is what shamanism is all about. This is what the psychedelic people are discovering as they descend into these trances.” “A shaman, and a psychedelic person, and a UFO contactee, is someone who has seen the end. They simply didn’t know what they were looking at, because who knows what the end looks like.” “The world is not what it appears to be.” “Psychedelic drugs are as important to the study of UFOs as the telescope was to the re-defining of astronomy.” “I think that the ‘real other’ need not be guarded by the frail efforts of a cults apologists.” “Now you may have thought telepathy was you hearing somebody else think. Apparently, that’s not what telepathy is. Telepathy is you seeing what somebody else means. It’s the visual acquisition of meaning rather than the audio acquisition of meaning.” “I think that we are on a collision course with a planet-transforming event, and that we have been for a very, very long time. I also believe that it lies below the horizon of rational apprehension at this point in time.” “That’s where the frontier of this hyper-technical fantasy is headed, toward a revivification of knowledge systems that were ancient when the pyramids were not yet even a gleam in the eye.” “I think we’re on the brink of a tremendous evolutionary adventure, and that it will involve physically re-designing ourselves.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option Conference on Precession & Ancient Knowledge Also see: C-RealmPodcast Episode 117: Aliens are ‘Real’"

What is it? Trickier, even trickier. The beautiful. What is it? Easy to discern. The beautiful is easy to discern. You are going to be condemned to live out the consequences of your taste.” “Beauty is downloaded into the human cultural milieu largely through dreams.” “On a planet where hundreds of millions of people are starving, the obligation upon the conscious people near the control surfaces, near the levers of the human machine is immense.” “When I say psychedelic I have something very specific in mind that a substance or a plant should do. It should not inhibit clarity, in other words not episodes of forgetfulness, lack of memory, passing out or confusion. It shouldn’t interfere with that, and it should transform thought. And it should be accompanied by visual hallucinations with eyes closed.” “The biggest danger with psychedelics is that while you are in that open state some moron will mess with you.” “Matter is not lacking in magic. Matter is magic.” “At bedrock, the universe is more like a DMT flash than it is like an 18th century garden party, as we were previously assured by the practitioners of science.” “An incredible ability to not register radical change seems to be a precondition of existing in the presence of radical change.” “But if I’m right, that the universe has an appetite for novelty, then we are the apple of its eye. … You are the cutting edge of a thirteen billion year old process of defining novelty. Your acts matter. Your thoughts matter. Your purpose, to add to the complexity. Your enemy, disorder, entropy, stupidity, and tastelessness.” “The psychedelic community is cleverly invisible. Because our choices in gender expression, fashion, and so on have, by crypto-osmosis, come to dominate the values of the culture, we can no longer tell ourselves from straight people.” “Basically, when you smoke DMT what happens is pure confoundment.” “DMT does not provide ‘an’ experience which you analyze. Nothing so tidy goes on. The syntactical machinery of description undergoes some kind of hyperdimensional inflation, instantly. And then you cannot tell yourself what it is that you understand. In other words, what DMT does can’t be downloaded into as low dimensional a language as English.” “One toke [of DMT] away is this absolutely reality-dissolving, catagory-reconstructing, mind-boggling possibility.

We could almost say that the universe, nature, is a novelty-conserving, or complexity-conserving engine.” “If in fact the conservation and complexification of novelty is what the universe is striving for, then suddenly our own human enterprise, previously marginalized, takes on an immense new importance.” “Each stage of advancement into complexity occurs more quickly than the stage which preceded it. . . . Time is, in fact, speeding up.” “No one is in charge of this process, this is what makes history so interesting, it’s a runaway freight train on a dark and stormy night.” “Science is the exploration of the experience of nature without psychedelics. And I propose, therefore, to expand that enterprise and say that we need a science beyond science. We need a science which plays with a full deck.” “What is revealed through the psychedelic experience, I think, is a higher dimensional perspective on reality. And I use ‘higher dimensional’ in the mathematical sense.” Definition of ‘eschaton’: “Eschaton comes from the Greek word ‘echatos’, which just means the end.” “The ‘hard swallow’ built into science is this business about the Big Bang. … This is the notion that the universe, for no reason, sprang from nothing in a single instant. … Notice that this is the limit test for credulity. . . . It’s the limit case for likelihood.” “We’re not mere spectators, or a cosmic accident, or some sideshow, or the Greek chorus to the main event. The human experience IS the main event.” “Our culture takes us out of the body and sells our loyalty into political systems, into religions, into inanimate objects and machines, collections, so forth and so on. The felt experience of the body is what the psychedelics are handing back to us.” “[The psychedelic experience] is not a journey into the human unconscious, or into the ghost bards of our human civilization. It’s a journey into the presence of the Gaian mind.” “The world is not an unsolved problem for scientists or sociologists.

This is a psychedelic truth, I think, of some power. And it relates to disease, and it relates to shamanism. Nothing is unannounced. If you’re paying attention, stuff comes down the pike, first the little waves, then the medium-sized wave, and then the tsunami. But you have to be really not paying attention to be fully astonished by something unexpected.” “What it is that’s coming at you, you can’t always say. But THAT something is coming at you is usually pretty clear, pretty clear.” [In response to the possible evolution of artificial intelligence] “It’s going to put our metaphysical propositions to the test. In other words, if we believe that intelligence inclineith toward bodhisattva-hood, then the bodhisattva are on their way. If on the other hand, intelligence doesn’t incline toward bodhisattva-hood, then probably the house-cleaning of all time is on its way. Because when these AIs come to consciousness and realize what has been done to the Earth, and so forth, they may be very pissed, indeed.” “Essentially what we’ve done is we’ve re-spiratualized the world, but we didn’t tame it.” “It’s very interesting, how the re-animation of the world has been accomplished without ever understanding it. That you could pass through the reductive phase of science, return to a kind of archaic shamanism, and still not have a handle on what does it mean to be a being, what does it mean to be a human being, what is the nature of embodiment in the world? Somehow we got to this place without answering any of those questions.” “Connectivity is the pre-condition for love.” “My view of, let’s say, the last thousand years, is that it’s been pretty progressive. And, yes, we probably killed more people in the 20th century than in the 10th, but there was more regret about it, more soul-searching afterwards, more questioning ‘Why? Why did we do that?’ “ “People are not invited to live simple agrarian lives in devotion to their children and their estate. But instead they’re invited to fetishize, consume, believe, join, vote, buy, own, invest. And all of these things bleed energy away, and disempower, and make people not fully human, but rather participating cogs in some much larger mechanism which serves its own ends: The accumulation of capital investment, or the acquisition of land, or the propagation of the agenda of some political party, or something like that. Our human-ness is constantly being eroded.” “The image I have of our community is, we’re like people in a dugout canoe trying to turn a battleship.” “Sex on psychedelics is the Mount Everest of the experience.” “If psychedelics don’t secure a moral community, then I don’t see what the point of it is. Otherwise we’re just another cult.” “It’s good to dry out occasionally. Very occasionally.” “It’s always puzzled me how this community has never really understood its roots in American Transcendentalism, or why we never used that hammer against the establishment. Because this sort of secular-mystical-Theosophical brand of thinking is just as American as mom and apple pie, and yet you rarely hear it invoked by our people. And yet it’s where our roots grow deepest, with Thoreau, Emerson, Melville, Hawthorn.

So casually we might call that Utopian fantasy. Although Plato did try to actually realize it in the political organization of a particular city. He ended up in jail for that effort. Another thing to kind of keep in the back of your mind as we choose whether or not to associate with this particular strand of the human endeavor [utopianism].”–Ralph Abraham “A restoration of the sense of the life of nature could lead to a new society in which heaven and Earth are mediated through human beings. Human beings would be the mediator of the marriage of heaven and Earth to bring about a harmonious relationship at the whole of nature on this Earth, somehow bringing human society into a right relationship between the Earth and the heavens.”–Rupert Sheldrake “If you restrict yourself to the realm of the rational, then you only have two choices: utopia or more history. And more history is beginning to look less and less likely.”–Terence McKenna “I see all these Christian fundamentalists running around, they also believe in the millennium. And they are the major anti-progressive force in most advanced societies.”–Terence McKenna “We have the money, the scientific knowledge, the communications systems and so forth to solve any of our problems, feeding the hungry, curing disease, halting the destruction of the environment. The problem is our minds, that we cannot change our minds as quickly as we can redesign harbors, flatten mountains, cut rain forests, dam rivers, these things pose no problem. Changing our minds is very difficult.”–Terence McKenna “We represent the individual atoms that are flowing together to make the transcendental object at the end of time.”–Terence McKenna “The historical record does not support the eschaton.”–Ralph Abraham  DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

Culture is not your friend. It’s not my friend. It’s a very uncomfortable set of accommodations that have been hammered out over time for the convenience of institutions.” “Culturally defined reality is some kind of intelligence test, and those who are joining are failing the test.” “The imagination is a dimension of non-local information.” “And so, these are the things, the exploration of which, the singing about of which, makes us human beings. The exploration of the universe of the unseen is the business of human beings.” “And what is shamanism but philosophy with a hands-on attitude. Philosophy not made around the camp fire, but philosophy based on the acquisition of extreme experience. That’s how you figure out what the world is,not by bicycling around in the burbs,but by forcing extreme experience.” “What they [psychedelics] cause is what I’m advocating, a fundamental revaluation of cultural values, because culture as we’re practicing it currently is causing a lot of pain to a lot of people, and animals, and ecosystems, none of whom were ever allowed to vote on whether they wanted this process to go in this direction.” “What is happening, I think, it’s really bigger than psychedelics, it’s bigger than human evolution. We are not making the waves in this ocean. We are corks, riding the waves of the ocean. But we are privileged, by perhaps chance alone, to occupy a unique moment in the history of the universe. A moment when the universe goes through some kind of self-transforming, evolutionary, inflationary expansion. That’s what’s happening.” “This is what I believe: That we are not pushed from behind by the casual unfolding of historical necessity, but that we are in the grip of an attractor of some sort, which lies ahead of us in time.” “The shaman is a person who is able to transcend the dimensional confines of cultural existence. . . . Only the shaman knows that culture is a game. Everyone else takes it seriously. That’s how he can do his magic.” “There is no contradiction between technology and spirit. There is no contradiction between the search for intellectual integration and understanding and the psychedelic experience. There is no contradiction between ultra-advanced hyperspacial cyber culture and Paleolithic archaic culture. We have come to the end of our sojourn in matter. We have come to the end of our separateness.” “There is a morphological enfoldment occurring on this planet. It is bringing forth some entirely new order of being. We are a privileged part of this.” “The plants are the pipeline into the Gaian intention. It’s just not a coincidence that these plants carry this immense spiritual message. They are the pipeline of Gaian intentionality.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

Because it really means that after 20, 30 years of unstinting distortion and misrepresentation by the media and some of the powers that be, that nevertheless the curiosity is intact, the opportunity is available, and people have not been fooled by the effort to denigrate, dumb-down, sideline, water down, sell out, whitewash and screw over the idea that psychedelic plants are an excellent and necessary part of any program of spiritual self-exploration.” “Our evolutionary heritage lies in the use of psychedelics. It was in all probability that psychedelics called forth our humanness.” “For all of its capacity to razzle dazzle, science has some serious drawbacks, some serious limitations that psychedelic experiences make more starkly evident, I think, simply because psychedelic people then compare the full spectrum of their experience to the paradigm they’re being offered.” “Nature is self-similar across scale.” “We can extrapolate towards cosmic processes by thinking about our own lives.” “In other words, we represent the quintessential gathering together of novelty. We are more than mere matter. We are more than mere biology. We are more than mere aboriginal culture. We are all of those things plus we are our skin of technical connections.” “The Big Bang is completely improbable, utterly improbable. It is the most improbable of all improbabilities. So just remember that when the fascism of science is telling you that astrologers don’t know what they’re talking about, and somebody else doesn’t know what they’re talking about. I mean, science has built a house of cards on worse than sand, quicksand!” “I’m willing to say I’m convinced that history is the annunciation of the nearby presence of a transformational event. . . . History is what happens when an animal species has its genome distorted by the nearby presence of a transcendental object.” “Love, in the heart of a monkey, which is what we are, is an effort to image this transcendental thing at the end of time. To love is to open to the presence of the Other, and that’s a very, very profound boundary dissolution.” “Ultimately at death, I think probably the only way you can meet death fully in command of your faculties is to love it, to surrender to it.” “What it might take you forty years to do through a process of rational analysis, and psychotherapy, and deconstruction, and so on and so forth, it can happen literally overnight on a sufficiently alarming dose of a psychedelic substance.” “One of the great things about psychedelics that is so corrosive to capitalistic values is that psychedelics show you that the best stuff is in your own head, better than walking down Madison Avenue looking in the windows is sitting in your shabby apartment on six dried grams [of psilocybin mushrooms] looking in the windows.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More Guest speakers:Terence McKenna, Ralph Abraham, Rupert Sheldrake PROGRAM NOTES: Today’s program features the second tape in a series of trialogue tapes that were recorded in September 1991 at a private recording session with Rupert Sheldrake, Ralph Abraham, and Terence McKenna. It begins with a wrap-up of their previous conversation, titled “Grass Roots Science”. And then they begin with a new topic, introduced by Terence McKenna and his plan for “Saving the World”. [NOTE: All quotes below are byTerence McKenna.] “If mere speaking about saving the world could do the job it would have been saved quite some time ago.” “As I look at the various factors which seem to be pushing the world toward ruin, the one I come back to again and again as being central to any social program which would create a sane and caring future for our children and lessen the impact of human beings on the environment is the problem of over-population. All other social problems can be seen as being driven by the excess of human population on the Earth.” “First of all, let’s just take it at face value: Each woman should bear only one natural child. Now what would be the demographic consequences of this? Startlingly, within fifty years the population of the Earth would be cut in half, without war, epidemic, forced migration, government programs of sterilization, and so forth and so on.” “A child born to a woman in a high-tech, industrial society, in the upper class of that society, will have between 800 and 1,000 times greater negative impact on the resources and carrying capacity of this planet than a child born to a woman in Bangladesh or Zaire. This is something we are not often told.” “Notice that you can say to this college-educated, upper-class woman, ‘How would you like to have more leisure time, save a pile of money, and be hailed as a political hero? All you have to do is limit your reproductive activity to one child.’ “ “I don’t think that the preservation of capitalism is a sufficient reason to ruin the world and rob ourselves and our children of a sane future.” . . . and from there, Ralph and Rupert point out a few of the problems with Terence’s plan and go on to propose yet another clever solution for saving the world.

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More Guest speaker:Lorenzo PROGRAM NOTES: Essentially, today’s podcast is a series of short notes to myself, little things that I don’t want to forget” [The following quotes are byLorenzo]“As my Mexican friends sometimes say, ‘If you don’t change your direction, you are going to wind up where you’re heading.’ “ ” My problem, I discovered, was that there had been far too much DOING in my life and not nearly enough BE-ing.” “I didn’t own my stuff. It owned me. … I now finally understand that nothing I possess is more precious to me than the opportunity to be able to appreciate a cool breeze on a warm summer’s day.” “When I stopped trying to save the world I also stopped trying to save myself . .. and THAT was a big mistake.” “Perhaps we all will have to first revolutionize our own lives, and then, on the foundations of our individual revolutions, will a new global consciousness arise.” “It seems to me that our beliefs are what ultimately shape our personalities. So who OWNS those beliefs? If I do, then I am a freethinker, in charge of my own destiny. But if my beliefs own me, well, then the institutions that formulate and promulgate those beliefs, they own me.” “I have finally come to grok the fact that the purpose of my life is not to reach a destination. Nor is my life a journey. No, for me at least, the purpose of life is to dance. A dance with no beginning and no end, just an endless dance.” “Here and now. Here and now. All else is but memory and fantasy.” TERENCE McKENNA QUOTES FROM THIS PODCAST: [The following quotes are byTerence McKenna]“People don’t take enough [psychedelics], that’s all.” “When we talk about the psychedelic experience, it’s not clear we’re all talking about the same thing.” “The way to do psychedelics is, I believe, at higher doses than most people are comfortable with, and rarely, and with great attention to set and setting.” “The psychedelic experience is as central to understanding your humanness as having sex, or having a child, or having responsibilities, or having hopes and dreams, and yet it is illegal.” “These boundry-dissolving hallucinogens that give you a sense of unity with your fellow man and nature are somehow forbidden. This is an outrage! It’s a sign of cultural immaturity, and the fact that we tolerate it is a sign that we are living in a society as oppressed as any society in the past.” “Get it straight. This is about an experience. Not my experience, your experience. This is about an experience which you have, like getting laid, or going to Africa. You must do the experience, otherwise it’s just whistling past the graveyard.” “This is part of our birthright, perhaps the most important part of our birthright. These substances will deliver. It is the confoundment of psychology and science generally, and that’s why it’s so touchy for cultural institutions, but you are not a cultural institution, you are a free and indipendent human being, and these things have your name written on them in big gold letters.

Fewer and fewer people want to study science in schools or go into it as graduate students. . . . It looks as if the great golden days, the golden age of the sixties and seventies of endless expansion, is over, perhaps forever.” Rupert Sheldrake:“So morphic resonance research has turned out to be cheap, indeed, almost free in some cases. And much of the leading research has been done by students as projects. And this has made it clear to me that students, who do tens of thousands of projects around the world are quite capable of doing leading-edge research. They are actually doing it in the realm of morphic resonance.” Terence McKenna:“I think that science has not only moved from the easy problems to the hard problems, in its evolution over the past thousand years, it’s also moved from the cheap problems to the expensive problems.” Terence McKenna:“Science is not done in the spirit of Greek curiosity about the order of nature. Science is done to make money on a vast scale.” Terence McKenna:“I think science has been vastly transformed from the simple impulse to understand the natural world around us into a kind of hellish marriage with capitalism, technology, enormous instruments, and the military/industrial complex.” Terence McKenna:“And I believe, I absolutely agree with you, there should be no such thing as classified scientific data. That’s an obscene concept.” Rupert Sheldrake:“The vast majority of psychedelic research, 99.999% at least, which has a lot to say, as I suppose you would agree, about the nature of consciousness, the range of imagination, and the powers of the human mind, etc. is not funded at all by official agencies.

If, on the other hand, it isn’t on automatic then what is the nature of the political and social world that we should construct for ourselves and our children?”–Terence McKenna “What we have is a future-phobic society that places a great deal of stress on the preservation of a pseudo-tradition called “Family Values” by some people, but it has many names. It’s not an archaic social model, or anything rooted in long-term human organization. It’s basically the 19th century industrial model of the couple with some children fitted into an industrial economy.”–Terence McKenna “It seems to me that a whole re-thinking of the notion of freedom has to come, and that it isn’t strictly a matter of more freedom.”–Terence McKenna “I think we’re going to have to go back to Plato. Plato did not trust the poets, and the heirs of the poets in our hell bard are Madison Avenue.”–Terence McKenna “The interesting ideas have to do with touching the taboos.”–Terence McKenna “I’m basically an optimist, but not because I have faith in human institutions. But because I think there is a transcendental attractor that will eventually pull our chestnuts out of the fire.”–Terence McKenna “I do believe that history is the proof of the presence of a hyperdimensional something or other, which is acting on ordinary biology.”–Terence McKenna “The government follows. It doesn’t lead. We need leadership now, and leadership comes from people, that’s us.”–Ralph Abraham “We’re not being led by evil people. We’re being led by jackasses at this point.”–Terence McKenna “Pretending that this catastrophe [a coming global ice age] is not probable will almost certainly guarantee that it takes place real soon.”-Ralph Abraham “Let’s avoid the disease of denial, because if we don’t admit a problem then there is no solution.”–Ralph Abraham “What free trade means is the right to sell crap everywhere. The right to deal Coca Cola in Afghanistan, that’s what free trade is, the right to sell Volvos in Turkmenistan. It’s a bad idea, free trade. We don’t want to make trade easier. We want to make the manufacture of objects and excruciatingly expensive process and the moving of them from one market to another damn near impossible, because what we want is the de-materialization of culture.”–Terence McKenna “The Great Leveling, which the Left always called for has in fact taken place in part, and that’s why you have less money. When the leveling took place did you think it was going to kick back into your pocketbook? You haven’t visited Bangladesh recently.”–Terence McKenna “The Nation State has become a Fascist tool, all Nation States. What these companies stand for is unbridled gangsterism.”–Terence McKenna “What we need to do is dematerialize our interphasing with nature. If we’re going to keep the body then we have to jettison material culture. We cannot have both the body and material culture.”–Terence McKenna “Yes, I think that we’re going to a grand destiny, and that the planet will survive this, but consciousness is the flashlight to throw on the path.”–Terence McKenna “History is an agitation in biology that proceeds the Eschaton, and it only takes it 25,000 years to rise out of the sea of chaos.”–Terence McKenna “Love is what lies at the end of the historical descent into novelty.

This causes me to sort of form a theory, just for my own edification, that cannabis must in some sense thin the boundary between the conscious and unconscious mind. … And if you smoke cannabis, the energy which would normally be channeled into dreams is instead manifest in the reveries of the cannabis intoxication.” Terence McKenna:“And what I really value about cannabis is the way in which it allows one to be taken by surprise by unexpected ideas.” Terence McKenna:“Alcohol, on the other hand, is demonstrably one of the most destructive of all social habits. What a bright world it would be if every alcoholic were a pothead.” Terence McKenna:“For the 19th century, and for all of European civilization, cannabis was something that was eaten in the form of various sugared confections that were prepared. And this method of ingestion changes cannabis into an extremely powerful psychedelic experience. … For the serious eater of hashish, it is the portal into a true artificial paradise whose length and breadth is equal to that of any of the artificial paradises that we’ve discovered in modern psychedelic pharmacology.” Terence McKenna:“To my mind, the whole of Indian and Middle Eastern civilization is steeped in the ambiance of hashish.” Terence McKenna:“Hashish, cannabis, has an ambiance of its own. It has a morphogenetic field, and if you enter into that morphogenic field you enter into an androgynous, softened, abstract, colorful, and extraordinarily beautiful world.” Terence McKenna:“There’s a deeper issue which is the zeitgeist, if you will, of cannabis, which carries a certain implied danger to establishment values which put such a premium on clear-eyed hard work and Presbyterian rectitude.” Ralph Abraham:“It [cannabis] is medicine for cultural evolution.” Terence McKenna:“If I judiciously control my intake of cannabis, it like gives me a second wind and a third wind to go forward with creative activity.” Terence McKenna:“It can turn you into a stupor, sort of lazy, loutish person. On the other hand, it can allow you to do very hard work for very long periods of time. So you sort of have to manage it, and I think a lot of people don’t learn to manage it.” Terence McKenna:“We [the U.S.A.] represent values which are incomprehensible to educated Europeans.” Terence McKenna:“Governments have always been, and continue to this day to be, the major purveyor of drugs, worldwide.” Terence McKenna:“The day the Russians left [Afghanistan], the hashish market in Northern California collapsed catastrophically and has never been able to build itself back to previous levels.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

The one I think is most popular among people who take seriously the phenomenon and think that the hoax theory is not the only possible explanation is that the spirit of the land itself, or Earth mysteries long embedded in these ancient megalithic monuments are sort of coming back to life again and somehow are being reactivated in Brittan’s hour of need, or that Gaia or the Gaian intelligence or the Gaian mind itself is involved in some ongoing dialogue or communication which principally has the effect, year by year, of attracting more and more attention. And the message year by year seems to be ‘Watch This Space’.” Ralph Abraham:“I think we should bet on the red and we should bet on the black. Probably you are right. Probably it’s a hoax. In case it’s a hoax, probably military, all right. But just as the fanatics of this phenomenon can’t dis the hoaxes theory to zero, neither can we reduce the non-hoax theory to zero, therefore, we have to keep our eyes open in case it actually begins to say some understandable intelligence to us. We can’t dismiss it completely.” Rupert Sheldrake:“I think this is the only rational position to adopt, namely to treat it as a natural historical phenomena, or at least a phenomenon. Let’s just say a phenomenon, to investigate it emphatically, I think, is Bacon Ian science.” Terence McKenna:“I’m claiming that orthodoxy is defending itself against magic.

Reason, and science, and the practice of unbridled capitalism have not delivered us into an angelic realm.” “We’re in, essentially, a tragic situation. A tragic situation is a catastrophe when you know it.” “All the boundaries we put up to keep ourselves from feeling our circumstance are dissolved [when using psychedelics]. And boundary dissolution is the most threatening activity that can go on in a society. Government institutions become very nervous when people begin to talk to each other. The whole name of the Western game is to create boundaries and maintain them.” “The drugs that Western society has traditionally favored have either been drugs which maintain boundaries or drugs which promote mindless, repetitious physical activity on the assembly line, in the slave galley, on the slave-driven agricultural projects, in the corporate office, whatever it is.” “Madness, basically, up until the level of physical violence, means you are behaving in a way which makes me feel uncomfortable, therefore there is something wrong with you.” “I think of history as a kind of mass psychedelic experience, and the drug is technology.” “History is characterized by its brevity, for one thing. We have packed more change into the last 10,000 years than the billion years which preceded it. And yet, as entities, as animals, meat, we have not changed at all in 10,000 years.” “What psychedelics do, and I think this isn’t too challengeable, is they catalyze imagination. They drive you to think what you would not think otherwise. Well, notice that the enterprise of human history is nothing more than the fallout created by strange ideas.” “The ultimate boundary dissolution is the dissolution of ego.” “The key, on one level, to maintaining the dominance hierarchy is monogamous pair bonding. That’s where it begins.” “We have the tools that would allow us to sculpt paradise, but we have the reflexes and value systems of anthropoid apes of some sort. . . . You don’t get serial killers in the chipmunk population.” “What the psychedelic experience does, really, is it stretches the envelope of the imaginable.” “It seems to me that culture, at least this culture, is a shabby lie.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

The time that we inherit from science is a time to humble you, to dwarf you. It tells you that the sun will not fluxuate for another billion years, that species come and go, and, in other words, on a temporal scale you don’t matter. And that now doesn’t matter. But when you look at the release of energy, the asymptotic speeding up of processes, we tend to be xenophobically oriented toward the human.” 41:50Terence McKenna:“This rising global humanism is, in fact, the rising into consciousness of a tribal god similar to the kind of tribal god that functioned in these pre-Hellenic societies.” 35:41Terence McKenna:“And the psychedelics, I believe, are the key to moving from wearing culture like cloths to recognizing that culture is this intensifying reflection of an aspect of the self and integrating it into the self.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

When we say “the bonds between people”, we may mean something more than a mere metaphor. It may be that there is an actual connection between them. . . . This kind of social bond, this kind of linkage, may be utterly fundamental.” 17:28Ralph Abraham:“Especially for people like Americans, who watch television for seven hours a day, there is somehow not enough time away from language.” 17:37Terence McKenna:“But notice that most prophetic episodes are dream episodes. I think that supports my point that we have lost connection with a kind of fourth dimensional perception that for the rest of nature is absolutely a given.” 25:59Terence McKenna:“Somehow language is a strategy for holding at bay a much more complex world.” 26:29Terence McKenna:“The obsession with intellectual closure is inappropriate to talking monkeys, because nowhere is it writ large that talking monkeys should be able to achieve a complete understanding of reality. I think part of what we have to do is live with unsolved mysteries that are in principle insoluble. They’re not simply unsolved problems, they are in principle mysterious. All would agree that the highest understanding resides in silence, but it’s the death of conversation.” 30:57Terence McKenna:“I question whether we actually think in words, or to what degree we do. What you notice when you experiment with these shamanic tools, such as psychoactive plants, is that as the intoxications deepen thought becomes vision, and one thinks in images. And I imagine that this is the aboriginal thought-style, and we must have thought in images for a long time before we downloaded into words.” 35:48Terence McKenna:“If a prophecy comes true, does that mean then that in principle all of the future is determined? You see, we have to avoid determinism here because a true determinism means thinking is pointless, because in a rigid determinism you think what you think because you couldn’t think anything else. So the concept of truth is utterly without meaning in a rigid determinism.” 37:21 Terence McKenna:“I don’t think the meaning of human existence lies in culture. It lies in the individual. And to access that meaning a certain amount of deconditioning, i.e., alienation, has to take place from a culture. If you’re just a cheerful representative of your culture you’re a kind of mindless boor.” 40:10Rupert Sheldrake:“There are astonishing powers in the animal and the other realms of nature, which we have just simply been blind to. We’re blind to them if we think in terms of institutional science.” 50:55 Terence introduces the topic of time into the discussion. 52:02Terence McKenna:“Examine, or recall to yourself for a moment, what it is that orthodoxy teaches about time. It teaches that, for reasons impossible to conceive, the universe sprang from utter nothingness in a single moment. Now whatever you might think about that idea, notice that it is the limit test for credulity. In other words, if you could believe that you could believe anything. It’s impossible to conceive of something more unlikely. Yet this is where science begins its supposedly rational tale of the unfolding of the phenomenal universe. It’s almost as if science is saying, ‘Give us one free miracle and from there the entire thing will proceed with a seamless casual explanation.” 1:02:38 Terence McKenna:“When these curves [about population, climate, pollution, etc.] are extrapolated, it’s very clear that we have taken business as usual off the menu.” 1:05:27Terence McKenna:“The ride to the end of history is going to be a white knuckle experience.” 1:06:02 Terence explains what he means by the word ‘eschaton’.

And what made it possible for the human animal is language. … Human language represents an ontological break of major magnitude with anything else going on on this planet.” “Language is the unique province of human beings, and language is the unique tool of the artist. The artist is the person of language.” “Language has made us more than a group of pack-hunting monkeys. It’s made us a group of pack-hunting monkeys with a dream.” “The glory of the human animal is cognitive activity, song, dance, sculpture, poetry, all of these cognitive activities, when we participate in them, we cross out of the domain of animal organization and into the domain of a genuine relationship to the transcendent.” “The psychedelic experience shows you more art in an hour and a half than the human species has produced in fifteen or twenty thousand years.” “The perturbation of brain chemistry is easily done. What is not so easily done is the assimilation of the consequences of this act.” “Culture is a plot against the expansion of consciousness.” “Art’s task is to save the soul of mankind, and that anything less is a dithering while Rome burns. … If the artist cannot find the way, then the way cannot be found.” “Nature is not mute. It is man who is deaf, and the way to open our ears, open our eyes and reconnect with the intent of a living world is through the psychedelics.” “The civilization that was created out of the collapse of the medieval world has now shown its contradictions to be unbearable.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

As human beings, as individuals, it’s very hard for us to be at peace with ourselves.” “We have not, in this culture, awakened to the depths of the crisis that surrounds us.” “Our culture is in trouble. Not trouble! We are at a terminal crisis, a bifurcation that can only go one of two ways, horror beyond your wildest imagination, or breakthrough to dignity, decency, community, and caring beyond your wildest imagination.” “The only thing I can preach is the felt presence of immediate experience, which for me came through the psychedelics, which are not drugs but plants. It’s a perversion of language to try and derail this thing into talk of drugs. There are spirits in the natural world that come to us in this way.” “When you talk about Gaia, it’s only an abstraction unless you talk about plants. The division between the masculine and the feminine is only trivially a difference between men and women. It is fundamentally a division between plants and animals.” “We have descended into a dominator pattern that is basically based on clutching, on fear. And I’m sure most of you have heard me argue that this is the consequence of ceasing, basically, to do enough hallucinogens in the diet.” “It is a crisis in consciousness which confronts us globally. Consciousness is the commodity that if we do not have enough of it, do not produce it fast enough, then the momentum of the processes we set in motion in our ignorance is going to sterilize the planet and do us all in.” “Ego is a structure that is erected by a neurotic individual who is a member of a neurotic culture against the facts of the matter. And culture, which we put on like an overcoat, culture is the collectivized consensus about what sort of neurotic behavior are acceptable.” “There are not rosy futures of suburban housing and ratatouille to be extended endlessly into the future. We are approaching a bifurcation where it is either going to become heaven or hell. One of the other.” “What we deny, as a culture, as a culture of materialist positivist reductionists, it the presence of spirit in the world, in ourselves, or in nature.” “I don’t think we want to set ourselves up as the crusaders for permanence.

Television influences culture, but if you watch television it’s psychedelics that shape the agenda of television.” Terence McKenna:“As a global society, possessing DNA sequencers and thermonuclear delivery systems and so forth and so on, we cannot have the luxury of an unconscious mind. That’s something that may or may not have some appropriateness if you’re hunting wooly mastedons and that sort of thing, but an integrated global culture cannot have the luxury of a large portion of its mind inaccessible to itself and somehow occluded.” Terence McKenna:“Technology, the evolution of languages and so forth have taken a turn toward ‘outing’ the unconscious. And computers are a wonderful tool for this, as are psychedelic drugs.” Terence McKenna:“High definition TV may give a surprising shot in the arm to the, at this point on-the-ropes linear uniform unitarians, because it’s going to be much more like cinema and photography. And it’s not going to have to be deciphered. It can be looked at, and this will have unexpected consequences on the sense ratios and assumptions operating within society.” Ralph Abraham(in 1991):“Video is doomed not because of a resolution limitation but because it’s not interactive. Interactive computer graphic games where you can watch the soap opera but also play with it to change the script, and so on, is bound to be much more interesting just because of interaction than video or cinema.” Terence McKenna:“So the conclusion is that civilization which welcomes psychedelics is the civilization that will lead and rule the planet.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

So that whatever he says will have[long pause]more effect than it actually deserves”[added with humor that was followed by laughter]. 08:36 Terence “shares his view” of Rupert. 09:12Terence McKenna:“And my intellectual method has always been to seek out the heretical. And so when I heard that Nature had called for the burning of a book [insert title], I burned up my tires on the way to the store to see if I couldn’t obtain a copy.” 16:38 Rupert introduces Ralph. 19:41Rupert Sheldrake:“His [Ralph Abraham’s] ability to visualize mathematics, I’m sure, is innate. But I think it was enhanced in the late 60s and early 70s by certain inner experiences, which would fall into the category of what Terence calls hands-on pharmacology.” 22:54 Ralph begins his introduction of Rupert. 27:21 Rupert tells the story of his first meeting with Terence McKenna and Ralph Abraham. 32:00Rupert Sheldrake:“Part of him [Terence McKenna] is a millenarian prophet. Part of him is a Dominican. He professes to be a pagan, but his Catholic upbringing, his Dominican reasoning, and his experience as an altar boy have never left him.” 34:16 Terence tells about when he first heard of Ralph. 36:43Terence McKenna: [Speaking about Ralph Abraham]“It’s impossible not to fall in love with the man. He’s the teddy bear of advanced mathematics.” 45:07Rupert Sheldrake:“[In science,] if you can do things cheaply, you’re completely free, because the only control that they have is through money and giving out funds. And if you don’t need the funds you can do what you like.” 1:13:39Terence McKenna:“What do I think? Well, not that.” 1:14:20Terence McKenna:“I’ve always felt that what biology is is a strategy, a chemical strategy, for amplifying quantum mechanical indeterminacy into macro-physical systems called living organisms, and that living organisms somehow work their magic by opening a doorway to the quantum realm through which indeterminacy can come. And I imagine that all nature works like this, with the single exception of human beings, who have been poisoned by language.” 1:19:36Terence McKenna:“The real question I’m raising is, to what degree does language create the assumption of an unknown future.” 1:24:03Terence McKenna:“We alone, I think, are tormented by the anxiety of the unknowable future. And it’s an artifact, I maintain, of culture and language.” 1:28:28Terence McKenna:“And I don’t believe that time is invariant. I didn’t intend to open this up as a general frontal attack on the epistemic methods of modern science, but, in fact, the idea that time is invariant is entirely contradicted by our own experience, and it’s merely an assumption science makes in order to do its business.” 1:29:36Terence McKenna:“As a practical matter, I don’t think we should confuse our ideologies with our sinuses.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

So maybe these things are just counter-flows in the intellectual life of the culture that redress each other.

We sort of have to part company with the planet for our own good and for its [own good].” 14:15“I think that the old evolutionary model, which was that evolution was the struggle of the fittest, and the devil take the hindmost, is pretty much discredited. And we now understand that what is maximized in evolution is not the sharpness of the fang or the length of the claw, but the ability to cooperate with other species, harmoniously. That’s what’s being maximized. … Humans are a perverse lot, and I suppose what one can reasonably hope for is incremental advances toward the good.” 16:02Terence begins talking about Ketamine. [NOTE: He is talking about injecting Ketamine, NOT snorting it, which is a more recent phenomenon.] 17:19“It’s [Ketamine] a troubling psychedelic, because a lot of people, I think, are doing it who have never done any other, and I think that would be very, very misleading.” 19:09“On Ketamine your definitions dissolve so completely that it’s a major accomplishment to realize that you’re a human being on a drug.” 22:39[Regarding synthetic vs. natural substances]“I’ve always taken the position that it was important that the psychedelic have a relationship to a plant.” 25:31“I am Oss and my brother is Oeric. … When we wrote that, that was straight transcription. That’s what the mushroom said.” [Referring to their underground classic, “Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower’s Guide”. 26:56“The mushroom has this peculiar ability to invoke, or allow, or trigger a voice in the head, this logos-like phenomenon of information unrolling in your head. No other drug that I’m familiar with does that consistently.” 37:52“What freedom means is you find out how good you are by discovering what you do when you have the power to destroy yourself, and we as a species are in that position and no one can do it but us. And if we do not destroy ourselves, then very obviously the intellectual tools that we have taken in hand are the tools which will send us out to the stars.” 49:57“Science did work better in the 19th century than it’s working in the 20th because reality is slowly slipping through its fingers.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More Guest speaker:Terence McKenna PROGRAM NOTES:  (Minutes : Secondsinto program) 05:33Terence begins with a discussion of “the felt presence of immediate experience.” 08:10Terence McKenna:“The thing I like about the Zippy culture and the house, trance-dance, techno culture is that it’s about feeling. The combination of young people, drugs, a fairly sexually charged social environment, and syncopated music is just all designed to draw you into you and your friends and your scene, and your hood, and your place in the cosmos and not sell you out as a consumer to Hollywood, or Manhattan-manufactured forms of entertainment.” 10:01Terence McKenna:“The culture is so capable of assimilating and disarming its critics through hype and fashion. I mean, I was horrified to see that ad, ‘Alan Ginsberg work kakis’. Did you see that!” 12:28Terence McKenna:“What Rupert’s [Sheldrake] theory carries as an implication is what Prigogine now proclaims, which is, what we thought were eternal natural laws are simply something more like habits. Habits of Nature.” 26:49Terence begins his discussion of paradigm shift. 28:57Terence McKenna:“So, human freedom is the precondition for the assumption of man’s flaw, man’s fall. You know, what Thomas Aquinas called the felix culpa, the happy flaw.” 30:12Terence McKenna:“A paradigm is a lens through which you see the world, and everything is transformed when you look through this lens.” 32:42Terence McKenna:“If habit is to replace law, then the universe is more like an organism. It’s more like a creature. It learns, It gains experience. As it matures it changes its strategy. As it expands its experience it gains new domains of emergent subtlety.” 36:36Terence McKenna:“The dimension of human freedom is a precondition for guilt. Only the free can be guilty because only the free can be responsible for what they do.” 48:37Terence McKenna:“What we call nature is a novelty-conserving engine, that what nature glories in is novelty.” 49:48Terence McKenna:“Sometimes for ‘novelty’ I’ve used the phrase ‘density of connection.’ “ 1:01:13Terence McKenna:“And when you think about it, if you really believe in eternal laws of nature then you have a philosophical mess on your hands.” 1:05:35Terence McKenna:“Mind is a phenomenon of metabolic activity. So far as we know, where there is not metabolism there is not consciousness.” 1:12:35Terence begins a discussion about memes. 1:27:49Terence McKenna:“We are very fortunate to live through an age of enormous reappraisal.” 1:30:17Terence McKenna:“Humor is an admission of ignorance. Ignorance is the precondition for knowledge. And in a sense, to take it to a deeper level, magic is a deeper perception than science. Because science believes that the world is truly there it is naive in its emphericism. Magic knows that the world is made of language. That the world is the construct of forceful imagination. And the people who don’t know this are walking around in the world of the people who do.” 1:31:27Terence McKenna:“Do not lease other people’s linguistic structures and live in them. Build your own virtual worlds. Build your own values and your own house of mirrors.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

So there’s something wrong on one level with what’s called empiricism, skepticism, positivism, it has different names.” 08:09Terence:“[Empherical science] is a coarse-grained view of nature, and what it mitigates against seeing are the very things that feed the progress of science, which is the unassimilated phenomenon, the unusual data, the peculiar result of an experiment.” 11:04Terence:“What I have a problem with is unanchored, eccentric revelations.” 13:39Terence:“Nonlocality, accepted, permits some of the things we’re interested in.” 15:26Rupert Sheldrake:“Weirdness and cults and most of the phenomenon you’ve named are phenomenon of Hawaii and California. When you live in England, things take on a rather different perspective. There’s a general level of popular skepticism, such that the general tone of an English pub is one of sort of skepticism.”Terence:“Well, but aren’t crop circles, and Graham Hancock all homegrown British phenomenon?” 20:33Rupert:“There is the possibility to return to a more common sense approach, common sense of the British pub type, and probably of standard American kind too, will often deal quite satisfactorily with the probono proctologists from outer space.” 21:59Terence:“You speak from your knowledge of the calculus and world history, and this person speaks from their latest transmission from fallen Atlantis. And this is all placed on an equal footing, and it’s crazy-making, and it also guarantees the trivialness of the entire enterprise. I just don’t think any revolution in human history can be made by fluff-heads.” 23:49Ralph Abraham:“In other words, there is no simple measuring stick of simplicity.” 23:49Ralphsays he wishes we could create a measuring stick to measure the truth of something and then goes on to describe how one could be designed. 31:31Terence:“The history of alchemy is far older than the history of science. It has always been in existence. It’s thinkers have always evolved and adumbrated their field of concern. So that’s one kind of fluff. Fluff with punch, because it has historical continuity.” 34:51Ralph:“The problem with this ’strict parent’ approach to fluff, is that some important discoveries may be shuttled aside.” 39:13Terence:“What we have to legitimize is critical discussion. So that when someone stands up and starts talking about the face on Mars people behave as they apparently behave in British pubs and just stand up and say, ‘Malarkey mate.’And force people to experience a critical deconstruction of their ideas.” 48:13Rupert:“If [scientific research] priorities were set by popular opinion, pet research would be at the top of the biological agenda, not the sequencing of more proteins, the cloning of more sheep to help the biotechnology industry. But instead, pet research isn’t even on the agenda. So it’s set by a small elite who bear no relation in their interests to the voters in a democracy who actually provide the money.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

And that means you’re in another dimension, where all points in this universe have been collapsed into co-tangency.” 16:56Terence McKenna:“Biology has a complete four dimensional, five dimensional map of the planet’s history.”Ralph Abraham:“What the hell, the comet’s on its way.

And I think that shamans have always seen the end. That the human enterprise in three dimensional space has always been finite.” 22:47Terence McKenna:[discussing knowledge of life after death]“But in fact, I think this is probably the paradigm-shattering, world-condensing event that is bearing down on us.” 25:04Terence McKenna:“That’s what life is. It’s a chemical strategy for the conquest of dimensionality.” 28:52Terence McKenna:“So even within the toolbox of ordinary quantum astrophysics there are ways of tinker-toying the syntactical bits together to produce incredibly optimistic transcendental and psychedelic scenarios.” 37:22 Terence describes his “simple way” of thinking about what may happen on December 21, 2012. 39:30Terence McKenna:“But I’m telling you, Ralph, there’s something out there. There’s something out there, and I’ll know it when I see it.” 40:06Terence McKenna:“Believe it or not, I hate unanchored speculation. And yet I find myself in the position of leading the charge in the greatest unanchored speculation in the history of crackpot thinking.” 43:33Terence McKenna:“I think people should drive out and take a look at the Eschaton at the end of the road of history. And what that means is psychedelic self-experimentation. I don’t know of any other way to do it. But if you drive out to the end of the road and take a look at the Eschaton and kick the tires and so forth, then you will be able to come back here and take your place in this society and be a source of moral support and exemplary behavior for other people.” 53:56Terence McKenna:“No one is directing or controlling the creative energies of this species. It’s being driven by thousands of micro-units called companies, all pursuing agendas they won’t discuss with anybody who hasn’t signed a non-disclosure agreement. So god knows what they’re doing out there, and they’re fiddling with life, and minds, and intelligence, and micro-dimensions, and you name it.” 54:57Terence McKenna:“It’s the future we’re living in, Hollywood creates it, and we have to swallow it until something better comes along, or until we get sick enough about that system to do something about it.” 55:43Terence McKenna:“I think here in the final moments in human history we should push the art peddle to the floor and attempt to pour as much beauty into the human design process as we possibly can.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

It would mean that family fields, with their morphic fields, would have a kind of memory from the families that contributed to them. The father’s and mother’s families of origin would come together in a family.” 12:12Rupert:“Whatever the merits or demerits of[Bert] Hellinger’s system, which I think is very interesting and apparently very effective, the idea of making models of the family field seems to me something that one could address in a more general sense.” 20:29Terence McKenna:“The family thing works because people really are complex chemical systems with genetic affinity.” 22:16Rupert:“There are amazing cases where young people commit suicide in a way that mimics the unacknowledged death of an ancestor, like suicide by drowning when an ancestor one or two generations before have committed suicide by drowning, but they’ve never been told about it because it was never acknowledged. And you get these extraordinary patterns that repeat.” 26:58Rupert:“We don’t have adequate models for these family systems, nor the influence of ancestors within them, which my interest in morphic resonance makes me very keen on.” 49:27Rupert(describing an indigenous belief):“But you have to be on good terms with the ancestors. And what being on good terms, above all, means acknowledging them. . . . that you name and acknowledge the key ancestors, you acknowledge all the dead in your lineage.

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More Guest speakers:Sasha Shulgin and Terence McKenna PROGRAM NOTES: (Minutes : Secondsinto program) 10:09Sasha Shulgin:“First, I am a very firm believer in the reality of balance in all aspects of the human theater.” 11:00Sasha Shulgin:“One definition of the tools I seek is that they may allow words of a vocabulary, a vocabulary that might allow each human being to more consciously — and more clearly — communicate with the interior of his own mind and psyche. This may be called a vocabulary of awareness.” 17:47Sasha Shulgin:[After a discussion of nuclear weapons.]“And to have such power leads to the threat to use such power, which – in time – will actually lead to its use. But, as I have said earlier, when one thing develops, there seems to spring forth a balancing, a compensatory counterpart. This balance can be realized with the psychedelic drugs. What had been simply tools for the study of psychosis (at best), or for escapist self-gratification (at worst), suddenly assumed the character of tools of enlightenment, and of some form of transcendental communication.” 19:24Sasha Shulgin:“But I feel — along with many others — that the efforts being invested in the technology of destruction does not allow sufficient time. It is possibly only with the psychedelic drugs that words of vocabulary can be established, which might tunnel through the subconscious between the conflicting aspects of the mind and psyche. It is here that I feel my skill lies, and this is exactly why I do what I do.” 31:42Sasha Shulgin:“My personal philosophy might well be lifted directly from Blake: ‘I must create a system, or be enslaved by another man’s.’ I may be wrong, but I must do what I can. And I will do what I can as fast as I can.” 38:44Terence McKenna:“The shaman is a very peculiar figure. He is critical to the functioning of the psychological and social life of his community, but in a way he is always peripheral to it. He lives at the edge of the village. He is only called upon in matters of great social crisis. He is feared and respected. And this might be a description of these hallucinogenic substances.” 40:15Terence McKenna:“Marcel Eliade took the position that hallucinogenic shamanism was decadent, and Gordon Wasson, very rightly I believe, contravened this view and held that actually it was very probably the presence of the hallucinogenic drug experience in the life of early man that lay the very basis for the idea of the spirit.”[NOTE:Graham Hancock‘sbook,Supernatural, provides a detailed investigation of this subject.] 41:46Terence McKenna:“The traditional manner of taking psilocybin is to take a very healthy dose, in the vicinity of 15 mg. on an empty stomach in total darkness.” 44:45Terence McKenna:“The Logos is a voice heard, in the head. And the Logos was the hand on the rudder of human civilization for centuries, up until, in fact, the collapse of the ancient mystery religions and the ascendancy of Christianity to the status of a world religion.” 47:36Terence McKenna:“It’s my belief that one of the unconscious reasons which underlies the odd attitude of the establishment toward hallucinogens is the fact that they bring the mystery to the surface as an individual experience. In other words, you do not understand the psychedelic experience by getting a report from Time magazine or even the Economist. You only understand the psychedelic experience by having it.” 49:47Terence McKenna:“And yet, WE are the culture that is in crisis. When you go to the rain forest you don’t find cultures in crisis except to the degree that they are being impacted by us.” 50:24Terence McKenna:“What he [R. Gordon Wasson] discovered, in the mountains of Mexico, was nothing less than Eros, sleeping but alive. The body of Osiris preserved over an entire astrological age, metaphorically speaking. In other words, that to take the mushroom was to transcend the cultural momentum of the past couple of millennia and return to a world where the Logos was a realized phenomena.” 54:00Terence McKenna:“Spaceflight is nothing less than the exterior metaphor for the shamanic voyage. In other words, in our terms, the hallucinogenic experience. This is the way engineers get high. They go to the moon!” 55:05Terence McKenna:“And that we cannot go to space with our feet in the mud. Nor can we in fact turn ourselves into an eco-sensitive hallucinogenic-based culture on Earth unless we fuse these dichotomous opposites. It is only in a coincidencia oppositorum, a union of opposites, that does not strive for closure, that we are going to find cultural sanity. And this is the thing that the entheogens, the hallucinogens, deliver with such clarity and regularity. They raise paradox to a level of intensity that no one can evade.” 56:15Terence McKenna:“If I can paraphrase Teilhard de Chardin for a moment, he said, or I will paraphrase in this way, ‘When the human race understands the potential of the hallucinogenic drug experience, it will have discovered fire for the second time.’ “ 57:02Terence McKenna:“Since the very beginning of culture, what we seem to be are animals which take in raw material and excrete it imprinted with ideas.” 57:20Terence McKenna:“Looking toward the day when all physical constraints can be lifted off of us, as they are in our imaginations, and we can erect the kind of civilization that we want to erect.” 1:00:41Terence McKenna:“The idea of psychedelic societies is something new. And it doesn’t necessarily mean that everyone takes the drug. It merely means that the complexity and the mysteriousness of mind are centered in the consciousness of the civilization as the mystery which it comes from and which it must relate to in order to be relevant.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

And, again, the antidote to this is an awareness of your immediate environment and the tricks that are being run on you and the ways in which we are being manipulated. Man is not bad.

If I had to point to a single factor that I thought was destroying society faster than any other I think it would be evil music.” 18:28Ralph:“The value of getting the true partnership into the church would mean that we then wouldn’t have to replace the church just because it had been on the wrong track for 5,000 years.” 18:48Terence McKenna:“But isn’t this a little like trying to reform the Soviet Union and keeping the Communist Party around? I think the momentum of these institutions makes them hard to reform.” 23:27Rupert Sheldrake:“I think the most important aspect of this process really, because I agree with Terence about the archaic revival, is to find behind the existing forms and existing festivals the pre-Christian roots, which in all cases are the ones that feed the timing of the particular festivals and the particular locations of the sacred places, and which ground the new religion in the old.” 32:39Terence:“In America attendance at church is much higher, and it convulses the body politic because, unable to fulfill it’s sacral function, the church has become simply a lobbying force for fundamentalist social policy. . . . I think we should level [churches] to the ground and start over.” 35:13Rupert:“There is little way in which the political life in America could be sacrelized, since by definition it’s secular.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

It’s not just confined to churches and synagogs. It’s the myth which encloses our entire scientific world view, which has grown up within this Judeo-Christian matrix.” 12:35Terence:“This is not paranoia. Paranoia? The Earth is on fire, haven’t you heard? There’s no reason to worry about being too paranoid. You can lift your foot off that pedal. It’s OK. You can go with that intuition now. The planet is on fire.” 18:38Terence:“So much is happening. Everything is knitting together. It cannot be stopped. There will be cellular technology and human-machine interface and uploading and downloading of clones of people and memories and places. The boundries are disolving into some kind of techno-biological informational soup of intentionality.” 19:12Terence:“It’s incomprehensible what is happening on this planet. It is like the metamorphosis that goes on inside a crysalisis, excpt this is a planet that is having its forests liquified, its oceans boiled, its populations moved, its genes streaming in all directions with all these exotic toxins mixed in. It isn’t for death that it’s moving. It’s moving towards some kind of other thing, not death.” 22:20Rupert Sheldrake:“Assuming that human consciousness doesn’t simply become extinguished at death, we have the question of what happens when millions of people die together. . . . an extraordinary flux of souls” 27:31Terence:“We don’t know what life is for or what death is for.” 28:13Rupert:“If the state of being after death is like dreaming without being able to wake up, so that when we die we’re captured in the realm of our dreams, we pass through this tunnel, and we enter a realm which is more like the realm of dreams than the life of waking experience, that there is indeed a post-mortal life in such a form, a form glimpsed in dreams in some kinds of psychedelic epxerience where the barrier that is penetrated may be like the membrane or barrier that we penetrate at death and may therefore be akin to near death experiences, which I think DMT probably is.” 30:28Rupert:“It’s an interesting question as to why the apocolypse is such a strong attractor.” 36:12Rupert:“It seems to us unlikely, given our old-fashioned cosmological view, that anything that happens on Earth would affect the rest of the cosmos. But if lots of Earths were synchronized [through morphogenic fields] then we do indeed begin to get the sense of the possible cosmic apolypotic.” 38:28Terence:“We have to believe that the universe is stranger than we can suppose, and that’s the way, by avoiding closure and keeping that in front of us I think we will not go far wrong.” 44:23Terence:“The middle name of chaos is opportunity.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

Because the United Nations report doesn’t tell the truth. It tells what the Americans want to hear.” 14:18“At the last Beckley Foundation Seminar, which was held at the House of Lords in London, we had the top of drug policy of the United Nations and of the EU. . . . and the United Nations man agreed with me that the regulations on psychedelics should be altered.” 16:30“At the moment it’s not illegal to do research on controlled substances, but no one does it because it’s not good for grant funding, or careers.” 19:52Amanda begins her description of the brain imaging work that is being done with high-level meditation. 25:03“In my opinion, to experience getting high means that you see a bit of you from higher up the mountain with a greatly enlarged area of simultaneous association of the neurons.

Have we seen anyone abandon their attachments and prepare themselves for this presumed, inevitable end?” 34:33“What he [Terence McKenna] said [about 2012] was . . . take this and test it. . . . And I think his greatest disappointment was that so few people actually took that challenge.” 36:36“I have had enough of this [focus on 2012 being the end of history].”  36:54“I have often equated the Eschaton with the idea of technological singularity.” 39:10“What I would say is that there is no such thing as artificial intelligence. There is only intelligence, whether it is vegetable, or animal, or mineral, all intelligence is one.” 41:16“Wikipedia is the first identifiable artifact of the age of hyper-intelligence.

It would be relating human life to the Earth, first and foremost . . . it wouldn’t have much emphasis on the stars or the heavens.” 08:49Terence McKenna:“But if this Anima Mundi thing got going, this is not a fine tuning of Christianity this is, at last, the overthrow of it. . . . no more this patriarchal, masculine, dominator thing that has descended down through monotheism.” 13:36Terence:“Why not psychedelicize and sacrilize green politics? . . . Science and green politics can be sacrilized through the psychedelic experience.” 14:33Terence:“I think that green politics, what makes it so wishy-washy, is its lack of a forthright metaphysics. . . . A green party that used a mystical language, a psychedelic language…would have, I think, a tremendous appeal.” 15:51Terence:“It has to be understood that this [using psychedelic medicines] is the way to the Gaian mind. These things are sacraments, not metaphors for sacraments, real sacraments.” 16:13Terence:“Everybody is going to try and out-green everybody else. The trick will be to tell the weasels from everybody else.” 21:50Terence:“If it’s to be a psychedelicized green movement, the people who could lead this have been training themselves for years. They just didn’t understand that that was what they were training themselves for, but called upon to do so they could step forward and operate in those positions.” 25:00Ralph Abraham:“The entire promise of the intellect has failed us if it’s necessary for the catastrophe to actually be upon us before people will act, and yet that seems to be the case.” 35:18Terence:“Well they are psychedelic experiences. The authenticity is going to come from the thing itself. We’re not talking here about reciting mantras. This is the real thing, you know.” 40:09Terence:“The only competition for that focus on the need to save the Earth is this stupid anti-drug thing, which is the need to preserve the purity of your precious bodily essences, or something like that. . . .

I concluded, after a lifetime of believing this and two years of actually working on this problem, that we’re not going to do this. We don’t have the technology.” 21.52“How rare are we in the universe? How rare a thing are we?” 24:02“These solar systems are out there. They’ve been bathed by our radio waves. Are there any receivers? Is there anyone out there to pick up ‘I Love Lucy’? Probably not. Why? Because those solar systems have all the wrong properties for probably our kind of life or any kind of life.” 29:39“In this chunk of the galaxy we’re the only noisy solar system. . . . We may be extremely rare. We may be the only ones in our little quadrant. We may be the only ones in our galaxy, or the only one in our local group of galaxies. Life like ours is unbelievably difficult to create. And here we are, our concerns are can we get to the office on time. We don’t even think about the miracle each one of us is.” 31:42“What I’m trying to build up is a picture of why you don’t need religion. All you need, if you want to be awestruck, is to consider the improbability of you, the improbable miracle that is you.” 35:05 [Commenting on a computer-generated depiction of an astrophysical zoom-out from Earth]“If the universe was at all attempting to find consciousness, for a split-second, a primate brain on Earth had in its little synaptic gaps a picture of the universe. The universe saw itself momentarily.” 38:48“What if the ultimate goal of life, of the universe, was to become fully conscious? And what I mean by that is the entire universe becomes, instead of this jumble of matter and quantum whatever, it becomes a single conscious being?” 42:02“For life itself to have a chance to expand out into the universe, and populate and infuse the universe, we may be one of its only shots [at this], at least in our area. We’re one of the only chances to do this, and we have a very limited window.” 46:52 Bruce talks about the possibilities ALife might explore should it ever be set free in a quantum computer. 51:18 Bruce tells the story about his vision (during the AlChemical Arts Conference in September 1999) of Terence McKenna’s ‘getaway car’. 1:03:57 Bruce begins a stream of consciousness riff about quantum reality that is packed with mind-blowing concepts and ends . . .“In the universe you are all participants.

This is not something unusual or statistically rare.” 07:57Terence:“The eradication of spirit from the visible world has been a project prosecuted with great zeal concomitant with the rise of modern science.” 10:01Terence:“If we examine the history of early modern science, we discover that some of the major movers and shakers were in fact being guided and directed in the formulation of early science by disincarnate entities.” 12:59Terence:“The aversion to the irrational is something that science inherited from Christianity.” 17:59Ralph Abraham:“I think it was in 879 in the council of Byzantiumthat spirit was made illegal, and then we went from three to two, so there’s only body and soul . . . and this is, I think, the reason why no one knows the difference between spirit and soul and thinks that they’re the same.” 21:01Terence:“Did you know that the dogma of purgatory, in Christian theology, was not created by theologians in Rome. It was created by Saint Patrick in an effort to make Christian doctrine more commiserate with Celtic folk beliefs in the process of converting Ireland to Christianity?” 22:12Terence:“The major tool for contacting these entities in any kind of controllable fashion is psychedelic compounds, especially DMT and the tryptamines. And those sort of experiences seem to line up pretty well with the Celtic fokelore.” 27:37Terence:“The irrational, in this objectified form, is very active in the process that we call history. It’s just that we don’t like to admit that because we’re committed to an official philosophy of reason and casuistry.” 33:57Rupert Sheldrake:“The realm of our dreams is a personal nightly journeying into these realms of other entities.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

This recent discovery effectively tells us the whole cosmos and every material thing in it has a kind of unconscious.” 18:34Terence:“I assume that psychedelics change your channel [of the imagination] . . . to a channel which is playing the classical music of an alien civilization . . . ” . . . “Appearances are merely the local slice of the divine imagination.” 29:26Terence:“A new phenomenon has been discovered in the universe, which is its drawing togetherness, its tendency towards cohesion, its tendency to move toward greater and greater states of wholeness, and not incrementally but in sudden highly punctuated stages that allow phenomenon like history or the 20th century to come into being. These are great leaps forward that nature pushes toward.” . . . “We each have our own apocalypse, and so I think we should live life in anticipation of it.” 32:02Terence:“I think probably self-reflection arose fairly early in the history of the Earth, and that the Earth is a minded, integrated kind of entity. . . .

There would be no way to rule that out.” 15:30Rupert Sheldrake:“If that’s possible [communicating with a star entity], what kind of information would such beings impart?” 17:27Ralph:“Myth is from mythos. Mythos meant the lyrics, the words of the song from the rituals. Myth gained the power it now has in our conscious and unconscious life through its secondary role in the ritual. The ritual and the myth together, I think, is one of the most important things for us to regain.” 19:11Ralph:“Peace [in Crete], I think, was not produced by just a partnership paradigm in a lucky society to have escaped the bad habits of the dominator paradigm. There was also the conscious interaction with the peaceful initiative of the celestial sphere in bringing peace down.” 22:12Terence:“I think when you go to the edges . . . then you discover there is an extremely rich flora and fauna in the imagination that has simply been ignored because our tendency has always been to look inward, to build inward, and to turn our backs on the raging ocean of phenomenon around us that entirely overwhelms our metaphors.” 25:02Rupert:“The spirit of Satan is the spirit of self-sufficiency, of being in charge, and the spirit of denial of the whole other realm. . . . So the guiding spirit of modern science, according to the Faust myth, is a demon. It’s in fact a Satanic demon, a fallen angel, Mephistopheles. . . . How seriously does one need to take the idea that our whole society and civilization may be under the possession of such a spirit, worship through money?” 28:34Rupert:“If we take seriously these entities, how much can we admit the possibility that there are these malevolent entities, like Mammon or Satanic powers or fallen angles, which are actually guiding and perverting the progress of science and technology?” 30:50Terence:“Probably the process of civilization is going to reveal the final status of this shadow within us.” 36:12Ralph:“I think we need the Gaian, and we need the Chaotic, that is the celestial sphere, to be re-connected, to be coupled, to the human spirit . . . that is the ultimate partnership.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More Guest speaker:Terence McKenna PROGRAM NOTES: (Minutes : Secondsinto program)1:05“I think that Maxwell’s Laws of Thermodynamics are only part of the story, and that you also have to look at the work that Ilya Prigogine did in the 60’s and 70’s where he showed that there is this principle-which they called different things, but, basically, it was random perturbation to higher states of order… Sometimes systems spontaneously organize themselves into more complex forms.” 2:30“Language is in conquest of dimensional expression-or, something is seeking to manifest itself in a domain of time and space of higher and higher dimension.” 2:50-4:33Terence uses Novelty Theory to describe the history of biological evolution in terms of an increasing ability to exist in and perceive higher and higher dimensions of being.“…better eyes, better muscles, better coordination, better ability to move through this revealed topological manifold with a temporal axis.” 4:40“What spoken language is about is the recovery of memory at a later date-it’s a data recall system.And you talk about the past… and you strategize from it… When you get to writing, this time-binding function is now totally explicit, the game is out in the open-the purpose of these endeavors is to keep the past from slipping away.” 5:42“The primate conquest of time (through time-binding technology) is the phenomenon that we call human history. This is apparently what we’re about, this is why we speak, why we write, why we invent phonetic alphabets and mathematical notation-because we are binding time. Well, you can then propagate that process forward to say, ‘What would satisfy this drive?’ Well, nothing less than a complete conquest of time itself.” 6:54“To make this leap to the full-coordination of 4-D requires some kind of machine symbiosis… It requires that we redesign and extend our nervous system over the entire planet, and that we undergo some kind of metamorphosis, and become, instead of semi-cannibalistic primates, machine tenders of a global nervous system, some of which is gold and copper and glass, and some of which is flesh and DNA and neurons, and this whole thing is in a state of self-designing foment.” 7:55In the preceding podcast (In the Valley of Novelty – Part 5, 35:27), Terence says that two important facts about nature have been overlooked by science. The first one (discussed in Part 5) was the increase of Novelty/complexity through time. Now, Terence begins talking about the second one (the acceleration of this complexification). 8:05“This process of producing Novelty… is not going on at a steady rate. It’s going on faster and faster as we approach the present. It’s like what mathematicians call a cascade… The early history of the universe is dull news… stars are condensing, galaxies are ordering themselves-this is the stuff of millennia, tens of millennia, greater spans of time… Once you get down to the last 500 million years on this planet, biology is the main show.” 9:42“When you reach the last million years, it’s as though this process of the emergence of Novelty both concentrates itself in nature into a single line-the hominids-but it also intensifies itself by orders of magnitude. So change is then happening on a scale of hundreds of years-languages are changing, pottery designs [are changing]-and as we approach the present, this becomes more and more furious. What Novelty Theory is saying is: this is not an easily explained phenomenon.” 10:56“Human history is the shockwave of some greater event about to emerge out of the order of nature. Human history-25,000 years is all it is-is like a shimmer, an aura, something that flashes across animal nature in the geological millisecond before the thing goes cosmic, or whatever it is that it’s going to go.” 15:08“We even talk about downloading [sic] ourselves into machines. Well, as we sit here [in the summer of 1998], we’re functioning at about 100 hertz. If you were downloaded [sic] into even today’s desktop computer, you’d be running at 200 megahertz. Suddenly 2012 would appear as far away as the bust-up of Pangaea is in the other direction, because you would’ve stretched time. All time is is how much you can jam into a moment.It’s very easy to suppose that we’re on the brink of a kind of weird pseudo-immortality, where time spent in circuitry is essentially time spent in eternity…” 16:08Terence acknowledges how much he was influenced by Teilhard de Chardin and Cardin’s conception of the ‘noosphere’. 17:32“What I call ‘Novelty’, you could arguably call ‘Information’. What I call ‘Habit’, you could arguably call ‘Noise’.” 18:11“The amount of order and disorder in any situation is dictated by the unique configuration of the local struggle between these two forces [novelty and entropy]… But the good news is… these two forces are not quite equally pitted. Over time, novelty wins… Order triumphs over disorder, and builds higher states of order. So, in a way, you could think of the whole process as what engineers call ‘a damped oscillation’.” 19:10“A lot of the words that I use to talk about this are taken out of Alfred North Whitehead, who is, to my mind, the great unread philosopher of the 20th century. He wrote a book called ‘Process and Reality’ in which he tries to build a general vocabulary for talking about Being, and it comes off as very psychedelic and very chaotic dynamical…” 23:15“Information is more primary than time and space, more primary than light and electromagnetism. Information is the stuff of Being…It’s almost as if it has a syntactical life of it’s own… it’s a virtual life-form running on a primate platform.” 23:58Terence mentions an idea from Danny Hillis, writer of The Connection Machine.“We were early parasitized by a kind of virtual life-form that lives only in syntax and is essentially time-sharing and piggy-backing our nervous system… So now we can think with this linguistic symbiot that shares our brain-space.” 26:40Terence highly recommends George Dyson’sDarwin Among the Machines. 29:40Terence talks about how his Novelty Theory and Rupert Sheldrake’s theory of morphogenetic fields are related, but different-which leads into a discussion of causation and freewill. 31:49“Novelty Theory is not predestination.” 34:28“The internet is a huge-and not fully comprehended-cultural step that we have now totally committed ourselves to. It’s nothing less than the building of a thinking nervous system the size of the entire planet,and… everything is running on this strange companion that we built to be indestructible… It has no nodes of control, and it’s the most complex thing ever put in place on this planet since DNA cooked itself out of the primal ocean.” 35:47“To the degree that people are psychedelic, they will be less anxious about what will happen, because what psychedelics show you is that there is life after history, there is something outside of culture.If you don’t know that, by one means or another, then you will define what’s happening as the end of the world, the literal apocalypse, the collapse of everything… [but] it’s just the collapse of historical, print-based cultural models and models of the self and the psyche. I embrace it. We’re not about to blow-out here, or go extinct…” 38:03In the course of a six minute response to a statement about the will of god, Terence talks about the anti-Deism motivations of Charles Darwin and other 19th-century evolutionists; summarizes Darwinism; touches on post-Darwinian developments in evolution-theory; and points out the discovery of ‘basins of attraction’ in chaos theory. 43:57“…and so, it [now] seems lessoutlandish to us, I think, to suppose there is ‘a purpose’.” 44:20-49:00Terence discusses astrology, the King Wen sequence of the I Ching, lunar cycles, sunspot cycles, and Chinese calendar systems. 50:46Asked for his views on schizophrenia, Terence mentions his affinity for the opinions of Jung and R.D.Lang.“It turns out that [schizophrenia], which we pathologize pretty confidently, actually is not that different from people who are having real, legitimate breakthroughs and understanding their lives in new ways. It’s a shifting and reordering of the dominance of the psyche…” 51:35“My really strong conviction [is that schizophrenia] should not be interfered with by depressive drugs. It’s some kind of a process, of a healing, of an acting out, and the biggest favor you can do the person is to let them, to the greatest degree possible, do what they want to do, and not interfere with them. And if you medicate them, and incarcerate them, the thing is aborted, and squashed, and distorted, and then they have a great deal of trouble ever getting their act together… How many psychiatric residents have even seen an untreated schizophrenic? The minute these people hit the front door of a hospital they’re given stelazine or lithium or something.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option"

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More Guest speaker:Terence McKenna PROGRAM NOTES: NOTE: All quotations below are byTerence McKenna (Minutes : Secondsinto program)2:10“Civilization has made us uncomfortable with our human-ness because these various technologies and phonetic alphabets and things like that have rearranged our sensory ratios from what they were in Paleolithic times.In a sense, [psychedelics] hit your reset button, they address the animal body, they address a deeper level than cultural conditioning,and so you feel and experience these atavistic images and feelings that civilization has repressed or transmuted in you.” 3:53“Cubism is created when Picasso brings African masks to Paris… Freud announces that… right beneath the surface… extremely violent, primitive impulses are [in us]… Jazz introduces syncopation… Women begin to display more of their animal nature through flapper-dancing… The whole of the 20th century is a turning back toward these values that had been repressed for millennia.” 7:15“Once you get to this place on what we might metaphorically call your spiritual quest, once you get to the place where you hear about psychedelics, the issue is no longer about, ‘Where is the gas pedal on the spiritual vehicle?’ The issue suddenly becomes, ‘Where is the brake?’… The doorway stands open, and all it requires is courage. Which is not to say it doesn’t require a lot…” 8:30“I’ve [taken psychedelics] many times. There are many people here who have done it many times. And, the survivors are not confident. It doesn’t build hubris in you. It doesn’t promote bravado, because you know how quickly and horrifyingly it can cut you down to size…” 9:02“Sometimes the issue of magic and power comes up-I wouldn’t get near that… My goal is to see more, to understand more, andwhat I do on a trip is damn-near absolutely nothing.” 9:38“It’s an incredible statement about our human-ness… that within us, under the influence of these plants, we have, literally, Niagaras of alien beauty…” 10:04“When I take mushrooms, I see more art in twenty minutes of behind the eyelids hallucination… than the human race seems to have produced in the last thousand years. On one level, that’s an incredible statement about the human capacity to generate and be in the presence of beauty. But the paradox is that so few people know this.” 11:50“[The ‘gratuitous grace’ of the psychedelic experience] is like a secret of some sort. And it’s a true secret, in that telling it does not give it away. I know this because I’ve been trying to tell this secret for twenty-five years, to anyone who would listen…” 14:20“If you study the mystical literature… it all triangulates toward unitary states. ‘Bodhi mind’, ‘the white light’, ‘the ineffable’, ‘the unnamable’, ‘the radiance’. Vocabularies… which indicate some kind of homogeneity. …[but] when you push [psilocybin] there seems to be… a revelation of multiplicity, of detail, of complexification within complexification… an overwhelmingly bewildering profusion of phenomena.” 17:08“…the great confounding fact that I’ve brought back from my excursions in these places is that there is an organized intelligence in there… far more alien than the cheerful pro-bono proctologists that haunt the trailer-parks of the less-fortunate… What does it mean that our culture has sealed us off from this information?” 19:46“What is the implication for the future [when] in this dark hour of complete over commitment to technology, economic solutions, rational reductionism, materialism, and so forth… this news [of psychedelics] arrives from these repressed aboriginal people that we have marginalized and humiliated in the process of building our own version of a global culture?” 21:28“…where [psychedelics] hit us hardest is in the domain of art and invention and novelty, and we have built a culture that-however hostile it may be to the psychedelic experience-is incredibly friendly toward novelty, innovation, creativity, cultural evolution, celebration of difference…” 22:14Terence notes science’s triumph over the methods of alchemy, but suggests that the alchemical ideal that,“…humanity is a full partner in creation, and that what God has brought into being, the human imagination can perfect…[is] a necessary faith for our time, because the power that we have is so great. If the power that science has given us does not serve a transcendental ideal, then it will serve some kind of fascist ideal…” 25:26“We have come to a place of bifurcations, immense choices. The decisions and the processes that are put in place in the next twenty years will probably put the stamp on whether humanity and this planet are made or broken as a cosmic concern.Well, consciousness is the key. What is dragging our boat is an absence of consciousness.” 26:01“You know, we have one foot in angel-hood, and one foot in the identity of a carnivorous ape, and the tension between these two, on a global scale, is excruciating.” 26:20“If there is [even] one chance in a thousand that [psychedelics] contribute an increased measure of consciousness to this situation, then they are a precious gift, a resource, an option, a possibility to be explored.” 27:17“An idea is not sufficient to transform us. It’s about an experience. And [the psychedelic experience] is the only experience I know that, in the time given to us, on the scale given to us, we have a hope of actually cutting through the detritus of our historical experience and building a true human community.” 29:58Terence spends the next 17 minutes of the podcast giving an overview of his Novelty Theory and its ramifications, beginning with how the theory came to him. 30:22“These psychedelic experiences… when correctly managed, end up giving you a big idea. That’s a really successful psychedelic experience.” 31:10“These flights into this realm of the logos-the real stamp of authenticity on them comes when you bring back a new idea, something brand new. That proves that you’re not just talking to yourself.” 31:28Terence talks about how science emerged/evolved from mysticism and mythology, mentions Thomas Kuhn’s book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and tells the story of how René Descartes founded scientific materialism at the behest of an angel. 34:45“I don’t say I channeled [Novelty Theory], because I find that vocabulary infantile and obnoxious. But, on the other hand, I don’t take credit for it in the way that I don’t feel elevated by my genius for having done this. It was definitely unfolded for me at a conversational speed by an intelligence for which I was little more than the secretary.” 35:27“Two [related] facts about nature have been overlooked by science… The first one is: As you go back in time from the present moment, the universe becomes a simpler place.”NOTE: Terence doesn’t mention the second thing until 7:55 into the next podcast (In the Valley of Novelty – Part 6). 36:20Terence spends a few minutes describing cosmological evolution in terms of the increasing complexification of matter that began immediately after the Big Bang and eventually culminated in the emergence of biology. 40:18“One of the things which makes this idea radical is that it doesn’t simply assume that history and becoming is the unfolding of causal necessity. It assumes instead that there’s some kind of attractor, that events are not just bubbling forward probabilistically and randomly, but that they’re actually caught in some kind of field that is pulling everything toward a conclusion.” 41:09“This is a huge law, if true, because it’s a statement about physical matter, it’s a statement about organic organization, it’s a statement about culture and society, it’s a statement about your own psychology. Things complexify through time. But science has never said this. The theory of evolution says biological systems grow more adaptive through time, but there’s been a real phobia against any teleological implication from that.” 42:14“…nature, on all scales, is some kind of an engine which produces complexity and then conserves it, and uses it as a platform to proceed deeper into complexity.It’s a kind of anti-thermodynamic flow… it’s what’s called autopsies by one school.” 42:46“…this tendency has been completely overlooked by science-in fact science’s most secure statement is Maxwell’s Second Law of Thermodynamics, which says all systems tend to disorder over time. But what it means is closed systems. All closed systems tend to disorder over time. Well, biology is some kind of a loophole in the laws of physics and chemistry…” 43:56“…physical chemists look at this and say, ‘Well, it’s ephemeral, but it just happens on the surface of the Earth, and it’s very fragile and death is everywhere.’ It’s a fluke, basically, is what they’re saying. But this is just their professional bias. Because you can go into the rocks of this planet and discover life in a continuous fossil record 4.83 billion years deep. The stars that you see when you look out at the Milky Way at night, the average star lasts 500 million years. …life on this planet has already proven more tenacious than the stars themselves… You can’t discount biology. Biology is clearly a player on a cosmic scale in this universal game of capturing energy and resisting entropy.” 45:42“We, then, look different to ourselves by this theory, because we are the most novel phenomena around…If, in fact, we have identified nature’s purpose as to create and conserve complexity, then suddenly… we are returned, for the first time since the sixteenth century, to the center of the cosmic stage of a universal drama of salvation and redemption.” 48:49“…so much power is being given to man, or taken by man from the universe, through the power of scientific understanding, that we are becoming the masters of the planetary destiny whether we want to be or not.” 50:15Terence quotes the French sociologist Jaques Allule:“There are no political solutions, there are only technological ones. The rest is propaganda.” 50:54“…we have to deal with the fact that we have built institutions that do not serve human purposes, but that are like automata or golems among us: corporations, religions, cabals, ethnic tribalism…These things are like the psychotic architectonics of the unconscious that the information age is causing to suddenly emerge for the inspection of those who have eyes to see.Our humanness is not endangered by machines, it’s endangered by these institutional entities…” 51:58“Corporate capitalism has the intelligence of a termite,at the organismic level, and all it understands is its agenda, and its agenda is to take cheaply extracted raw materials and fabricate them into expensive finished products… and it can’t propagate that cycle on the closed surface of this planet much longer without the contradictions becoming unbearable. But it doesn’t know that.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option These program notes were compiled by Bill, who joins us in the Psychedelic Salon from his home in Japan."

        "description": "Subscribe:RSS|More Guest speaker:Terence McKenna PROGRAM NOTES: (Minutes : Secondsinto program) 3:08“…the story of the universe is that information, which I call novelty, is struggling to free itself from habit, which I call entropy… and that this process… is accelerating… It seems as if… the whole cosmos wants to change into information… All points want to become connected…. The path of complexity to its goals is through connecting things together… You can imagine that there is an ultimate end-state of that process–it’s the moment when every point in the universe is connected to every other point in the universe.” 4:43“On one level, I think there is a cultural singularity… a place in our cultural development where we can’t predict or understand what will happen to us… a kind of flip-point… or doorway… or revelation…” 5:20“The human adventure has become the cutting-edge of cosmic destiny, but it won’t always be so…” 7:04“…we wished for transformation. Western civilization built it into it’s cultural agenda… and now, under the aegis of market-capitalism… somebody is going to put something together that is just going to completely redefine and rewrite the nature of reality itself… I’ll bet you it’s some kind of technology/drug-type thing… It may already be here.” 8:18“What do you do when you can do anything? That’s really the question at the end of history. Once you have overcome all limitation, what is the human agenda?” 8:53In response to a question about the role of individuals who are becoming aware of the approaching cultural singularity:“…I think we’re more than watching–I think that we spin it. We’re the spin doctors of the thing. In other words, if there’s a prophecy that must be fulfilled, it’s a kind of general prophecy… [It] is open to human definition through specific acts of creation.” 9:34“The levels of novelty or habit in any given moment will be fulfilled–but how they’re fulfilled is a matter of human decision.” 11:00“The strangeness of our condition signifies the nearness of the attractor. The reason that our world is accelerated… is because of the nearby presence of this cultural black hole, this singularity of technology and biological intent, that is feeding backwards into time these apocalyptic images…” 11:55“In the collective unconscious–in which, each of us shares a part–the thing at the end of time is spinning… and it’s throwing off scintillations, which are distorted images of itself. The transcendental object at the end of time infects the history that precedes it with the images of its approaching unfoldment. This is what I mean when I say, ‘History is the shockwave of eschatology.’ The presence of history on this planet means this thing is moving beneath the surface–this protean form. When it manifests, it will shed the institutions of history the way a butterfly sheds a chrysalis.” 13:32Terrence suggests that Novelty Theory might explain the apparent existence of ‘dark matter’ and ‘dark energy’ in the universe. 14:25“…I don’t believe that 90% of the matter in the universe goes unobserved… It’s not that there’s mass missing–it’s that there’s a law missing.” 15:01“…Why does the Milky Way tend to stay the Milky Way? The answer is: because, as a spiral galaxy, it’s a more complex organism, a more complex structure, than it is as a dissipated, homogeneous mass.” 15:42“…the Novelty Constant… is the constant that then causes large-scale structures to persist through time, for no other reason than that they represent higher orders of organization.” 16:40Finding support in contemporary astrophysics’ postulation of an anti-gravitational factor that causes the universe to grow outward forever (and not collapse on itself), Terrence notes that:“…one of the things Novelty Theory says is [that] the universe never goes back to its initial conditions.” 20:36“You can’t conceive of information in a way that the hallucinogens can’t then see your bid and raise the ante.” 21:15Terrence gives a seven minute summary of how his interest in the I Ching developed into a mathematical analysis of the King Wen Sequence, culminating in his Timewave theory. 28:12“I don’t say, ‘If you take mushrooms, you’ll find yourself caught up in the dynamics of the Mayan calendar.’ But you might. Many have.” 28:25“I’m more rational than I may sound, here,,, because I doubt. I know absolutely how flakey this sounds… I’m not here to found a cult. I just had a very wiggy experience… The problem with most people’s really wiggy experiences is that it never gets down to the nitty-gritty…” 30:03“…[but] the good thing–in my view–of what happened to me is, it actually got down to a mathematical proposition… a hypothesized law…” 30:40Terrence compares his ‘discovery’ of the Timewave to another “mathematical download”: ‘The Myth of Er’, and Plato’s description of the ’spindle of Necessity’, from the 10th book of Plato’s Republic. 32:00“[the I Ching] is a mathematical notation system… for the purpose of creating a physics of Time…based on human observation, and… it arises in a context, we presume, of shamanism and proto-Taoist values.” 32:57“The essence of understanding Time lies in understanding organism. So it yields to a very low-tech, observational style of natural science, which we call yoga. By looking inside the body and the mind, as you still gross physiological functions, subtler and subtler shells of vibration and emanation and physiological activity come into view, and… my hypothesis is that, eventually, if you do this with sufficient care and attention, you get down to… the level of the primal quantum-mechanical vibrations that lie behind everything. In other words, you are in the realm of the primal patterns, whose activity downloads and eventuates as the macro-physical world.” 35:32“Time is not (as Newton thought) pure duration, some kind of intellectual abstraction necessary for a serial universe. Time is a real thing. It’s as palpable as electricity. It’s as real as radiation. It’s a thing. And so, what’s going on is: Objects which arise in time carry the impress in their structure of the medium in which they arose. And so organism becomes a microcosmic downloading, a mapping of the architectonics of Being.” 40:20“…Life is undergoing some kind of conquest of geometry. I almost picture it like protoplasm flowing into a crystal landscape–we conquer this geometry by assuming its shape, in some sense. So, it transforms us, even as we overrun it.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option These program notes were compiled by Bill, who joins us in the Psychedelic Salon from his home in Japan."

It actually worked—on someone who thought nothing would work.” 4:06“What I like to talk about [at these gatherings]—and what I have very little competition in terms of talking about—is the content of the psychedelic experience, which is very difficult to ‘English’, or to bring into any other language.” 4:39“…that was sort of my core specialty, if you will: the ethno-pharmacology of consciousness and the phenomenology of the states there derived. But, after 25 or 30 years of doing this, it bleeds into all kinds of larger categories, like, ‘What is art?’, ‘What is human history?’, ‘What is the religious impulse?’, ‘What is the erotic impulse?’, ‘What is mathematics?’… ‘What is the future?’…” 5:50Terence gives a brief personal history (childhood-1998). 9:20“…psychedelics are actually a kind of miraculous reality that can stand the test of objective examination …there’s nothing ‘woo-woo’ about it. It has to do with perturbing states of brain chemistry and standing back and observing the effects wrought thereby.” 12:49“…I think a lot of people who have never taken psychedelics have the idea that it’s thermodynamic noise, that it’s just the brain isn’t working right, it’s firing randomly, and then some portion of it is trying desperately to lay gestalts of meaning onto this random firing, and so you get this kind of surreal careening from one supposed illusionary perception to another. Anybody that’s taken psychedelics knows this is not a very apt or cogent description…” 14:01“I do not say that this is the only path out of the mundane coil of blind casuistry and entropic degradation. I don’t say it’s the only path out—it’s the only path I found. And I checked some of the other major players… Perhaps yoga can deliver this, perhaps Mahayanist metaphysics can deliver these things. Perhaps I was impatient, or lumpen, or simply not intelligent enough. But the good news about psychedelics is that they are incredibly democratic—even the clueless can be swept along if the dose is sufficient.” 15:30“…[the historical process] is inevitably ramping up into more and more hypersonic states of self-expression… and this is what’s causing this ‘end of history’ phenomenon, this eschatological intimation that now haunts the cultural dialogue. There is something deep and profound moving in the mass psyche… now exacerbated and focused by new communications technologies that are essentially prostheses, extensions of the human mind and body…” 18:10“…at least since I read McLuhan and assimilated his notion of tools as things which have a feedback into how we see the world, it seemed to me that the psychedelic state was then like a predictive model for what human history wanted to do. Human history wants to break through all boundaries, to somehow have a realized collective relationship with deity, or with that which orders nature…” 18:56“[The depth/meaning of the psychedlic experience] is all in the ‘implications’.It has to do with how much intelligence you bring to it in the beginning. If there’s no mind behind the retinal screen, then it’s just mental pyrotechnics.It’s how much we can make of the phenomenon that makes it so rich.” 19:30“[Aldous Huxley] was asked at one point: ‘What is the psychedelic experience?’ and he said, ‘It’s a gratuitous grace… It is neither necessary for salvation, nor sufficient for salvation.’ But it certainly makes it easier…One has attained a very fortunate incarnation, I think, to be in a culture, in a place, in a time when psychedelic knowledge is available.” 20:20“It’s a kind of paradox that… the hubristic enterprise of white man anthropology carried back all these medicine kits and mojo-bags and sacred plants and so forth and grew them in university botanical gardens and kept the stuff in locked drawers—it was like a Trojan Horse brought inside the city walls of Calvin’s Troy, and now the genie is out of the bottle.” 26:24“…the reason for the emphasis on shamanism and other techniques is: you will need techniques if you go into the deep water; and they can make your life very simple and save you from unnecessary suffering. Not all suffering is necessary. Maybe no suffering is necessary.” 26:54“One of the things that I’m keen to talk to you about is [that] there are various models of the psychedelic experience: that it’s the Jungian unconscious, that it’s the ancestor world, that it’s this or that. The one that I’m most struck by is [that] it’s the world of the Platonic ideals, it’s a world very closely related to mathematics. And in a way the shaman is a hyper-mathematician—not in that he proposes theorems and solves them, but that he perceives hyper-dimensionally.” 28:58“My motivation is, basically, curiosity… I’m fascinated that we’ve gotten this far. I mean, given that the most economical situation would be pure nothingness: What is this [reality]? Why is nature doing these things? Why does organization have such tenacity? What does it mean that we appear so late in the process and represent such a difference in nature?” 29:44“We get used to reality because it’s so stable, but in fact, it’s an absolutely confounding situation.” 30:15After Terence mentions an Evelyn Underhill book on mysticism:“…I wanted these [mystical] experiences at a younger age… The thing that’s so powerful about the psychedelics is that they perform on demand, which, almost in principle, you cannot expect of a mystical experience, because that would be, essentially, man ordering God at man’s whim.” 31:23“[The psychedelic] seems magical in the sense that it seems to respond to human will. One decides whether this is the evening or not. And sometimes people have said to me, well, don’t you want to achieve these things ‘on the natch’? Well, to me, that suggests a certain degree of out-of-controlness…” 32:22“…it’s the difference [between] waiting in an attitude of the expectant supplicant, or being the hierophant… and being able to call down the power, or go up to the power, at will. And that’s a fantastic thing, and a responsibility.” 34:44“Part of what the psychedelic point of view represents is living a certain portion of your life without answers. Just accepting that certain dilemmas will never resolve themselves into some kind of a complete answer.That’s why psychedelics are so different from any system being sold, from one of the great elder systems like Christianity, to the latest cult…” 36:20Terence spends about six minutes discussing the pharmacology of DMT, focusing on plant sources and synthesis. 44:10Terence recommends the the work of Mayan calendar expertJohn Major Jenkins.

He is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society; a founding and life member of the Rainforest Club; a Fellow, two-term Director, and past Ombudsman of The Explorers Club, as well as serving three terms as Chairman of the San Diego Chapter. He is the recipient of five Explorers Club Flags, a licensed sea captain, an open water diver, and a founding member of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology. And I should add that he is a friend of mine. I invited Rio to the salon to tell his stories about the time in the Amazon when Terence and Dennis McKenna joined Wade Davis on the RV Heraclitus for their now-legendary meeting in the jungle. However, the high (no pun intended) point of our conversation was his in-depth discussion of datura. This is the first time that datura has been discussed in the salon.

(PDF Version) “This is a struggle between novelty and habit.” . . . “[Your culture] is the greatest barrier to your enlightenment, your education, and your decency.” . . . Cultures are virtual realities made of language.” One of the things Terence covers in this talk is his take on virtual reality, VR. On February 25th, about two months before this talk, Terence participated in an experiment in avatar-based random in 3D virtual worlds on the Internet. “We were operating live from Terence’s jungle retreat on the Big Island of Hawaii on a wireless packet radio network. The hosting area was finished off in the couple of hours before we went live at 3 pm Hawaii time. Fans were already arriving by that time and helping out by finding audio files to be linked in, images and other Terence netmorabilia. Approximately 40 fans showed up with very short notice from an announcement posted on Terence’s fan lists. Another 20 or show streamed in for days after the event, to be met by “super fan” Roy Batty. In the meantime, see Cathie Leavitt’s “Trip Report” for an excellent first hand newbie view of the experience.”[FromDigitalSpace.com. . . article about Terence and 3D virtual worlds] DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option "

Somehow syntax–which is normally the invisible architecture behind language–has moved into the foreground, and you can see it… it’s crawling all over you…” 10:32“…and [the machine-elves] hold out objects, which they sing into existence… and… what [the objects] are like is–and, in fact, this is probably what they are–what they are like is three and four and five-dimensional puns…” 10:54“These objects that [the machine-elves] are making are made by utterances…” 14:32“Well, somebody once asked me, you know, ‘Is it dangerous?’ And the answer is: Only if you fear death by astonishment.” 17:28“The process of ‘doing language’, in us, is not yet finished… and what we’re on the brink of… is a much more seamless kind of fusion of minds by generating topological manifolds that we look at, rather than localize into designated meaning.” 19:46“And the reputation of Ayahuasca is ‘group states of mind.’ Well, if you’re naïve, then you think you’re gonna hear everybody thinking–but no, you’re going to see everyone thinking, you know, you’re going to see what people mean.” 20:26“…now we’re close to [Marshall] McLuhan country here. I think what this means is that print skewed our perceptual apparatus… toward the acoustical space, so that, for us, thought became a voice.” 24:19“In the last 150 years we go from photography, to color photography, to moving colored photography… with stereophonic sound, and [now] pointing toward virtual reality, with more and more money to be made each step of the way… We will produce simulacrums of imaginary worlds.” 25:28“I think the transformation of how we ‘do’ language is part of this acceleration into singularity.” 28:07“…culture is not your friend. Culture is an impediment to you understanding what is going on. That’s why, to my mind, the word ‘cult’ and the word ‘culture’ have a direct relationship to each other.” 30:05“Since all culture is a kind of con game, the most dangerous candy you can hand out is candy which causes people to start questioning the rules of the game.” 36:50In response to a long question about language and it’s connection to cosmological and biological creation/evolution, Terence talks about the word ‘language’ and some distinct types of syntactic organization that it is sometimes used to refer to (and about how he believes spoken language may have come about). 43:30“…fire is half a million years [old]… Language [is only] 35,000 years old? Language is everything we are, everything we do, you can’t think without it… and yet, if it’s that new, then what it represents is simply a technology, a form of media…” 44: 16“…in a sense, every creative act is the paradigmatic act of the Big Bang.” 52:16“…technology itself is a kind of psychedelic… The web is incredibly subversive…” 54:12“I really see art as the great searchlight that illuminates the historical landscape just ahead, and I think art is about to get teeth for the first time in human history… We will build art that will literally stand your hair on end.” DownloadMP3PCs – Right click, select optionMacs – Ctrl-Click, select option These program notes were compiled by Bill, who joins us in the Psychedelic Salon from his home in Japan."

Different meditations strive for different things. Much meditation is about emptying the mind of phenomena. This would certainly not be a description of the psychedelic state.” 4:14“Ultimately, the meditation path and the psychedelic path must somehow lead to the same kinds of data if the claims of both are to be respected, which is that they give deeper knowledge about reality.” 6:03“The chemistry of DMT suggests that, in deep REM sleep, it’s possible every single night you have a DMT flash, but it does not transcript into short term memory.” 6:20“…or imagine a drug that allowed you to enhance long-term memory, so that you could slip into reveries of a summer day 30 years ago, and play it back, moment by moment by moment. Again, this is not shooting for the moon, pharmacologically…” 6:58“It’s a false dichotomy, the idea that somehow you should be able to achieve these things ‘on the natch’, and they’re not authentic if you achieve them through psychedelics. This is just a con…” 7:55Terrence tells the story of how his ‘gringa’ friend telepathically knocked a Peruvian shaman’s nephew off of his feet. 10:30“Where the problem area lies–people think it lies in taking too much– [but] it lies in taking too little, because if you take too little, you can resist it, you can struggle with it…” 12:17Terrence describes how he takes mushrooms. 14:00“The most mind-boggling parts of it are just not possible to bring out of it, because language fails, because English–there are no words…” 14:30Terrence talks about fear during a psychedelic experience, and how to deal with it. 15:39“The thing to do is to sit up, and to sing.” 18:53“…the ego feels threatened by the boundary-dissolution… and it can actually say to you, ‘You are dying, and here’s the evidence.’ And you have to say: ‘No, it’s unlikely,’ and sing your way through it.” 22:24Terrence speculates that some psychedelic-seeming aspects of Tibetan/Mahayana Buddhism may have actually resulted from ancient experiences with psychedelics and/or cannabis. 26:39“What always fascinated me was hallucination, because it was, to me, the proof that I was dealing with something outside myself. …a single image would have taken me hours to draw and figure out…” 28:49“The impression you have when you smoke DMT is: This isn’t a drug… this is something else… this is a doorway into another modality that exists all the time, independent of my thoughts or feelings about it… It certainly doesn’t seem to be a place designed to fit human expectations.” 32:18Terrence speculates about the future of the ‘free individual’ in the electronic/information age:“…[whether] each of us will become a kind of god… [or will we become] …a socialist gas… a hive-mind…” 36:28“Part of the thing I found with hanging with shamans… is that, once you get past the language barrier… shamans… are simply curious people–intellectuals of a certain type.” 37:05“…the shamans, who are the keepers of the cultural values, are also… keepers of the secrets of the theatrics of the cultural values, and so they live their lives in the light of the knowledge that it all rests on showbiz.” 37:41Refering to Shamanism: The Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy and History, The Eternal Return, two books by Mircea Eliade:“…the shaman is socially marginal… and is feared by the people… [but] then the shaman comes forward in this critical role as… mediator between the cultural mind and the real world.” 40:17“…the logos–the alien A.I., the higher and hidden god that is trying to reach down to you and deliver the message–is a collagist. It can’t really compose the message except out of bits and pieces of what you already posses.” 44:20Terrence tells his story about the “good shit” miracle.
